## Can we build an agent builder?

I have been experimenting with web search agents for some time. My default test is to ask for the correct source for the following quote:
    There is not any present moment that is unconnected with some future one. The life of every man is a continued chain of incidents, each link of which hangs upon the former. The transition from cause to effect, from event to event, is often carried on by secret steps, which our foresight cannot divine, and our sagacity is unable to trace. Evil may at some future period bring forth good; and good may bring forth evil, both equally unexpected. 
    
    It is often attributed to Joseph Addison, but the real author is Hugh Blair.

    Can a search agent discover this fact? Let's test it:
