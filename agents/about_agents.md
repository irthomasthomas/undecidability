Creating a raw content outline for a new 'agents' section in a GitHub project can be much about balancing thorough documentation with readability and utility. Here is an example of how such a section might be structured in Markdown, with proposed next steps. This will assume a file structure and naming convention that fits in with the existing project:

# Agents

## Overview 🌐

Agents are autonomous or semi-autonomous entities within the 'undecidability' project that interact with code, data, and other systems to perform tasks, run trials, and aid in development.

## Types of Agents 🤖

- **Vision Agent**: Converts images to code snippets, creates diagrams, and assists with screen recordings.
- **Trial Agent**: Engages in verification and code challenges, conducting trials and compiling reports on outcomes.
- **Git Agent**: Manages version control integration, automates commit messages, and monitors repository health.
- **Chatbot Agent**: Assists developers with queries and provides information on demand using natural language processing.

## Key Features 🗝️

- Automated workflow integration
- Self-monitoring capabilities
- API connectivity for enhanced functionality
- Limited filesystem access to ensure security

## Next Steps 🛤️

1. Develop a framework for each type of agent to operate within.
2. Implement a prototype for a single agent, likely the Vision Agent, due to its straightforward application.
3. Set up a logging system to allow agents to report activities and outcomes.
4. Create a security model that defines what each agent can and cannot do within the system.
5. Establish communication protocols between agents and other parts of the system.

## Documentation Standards 📚

Agents documentation should be written in a clear and consistent manner. Use mermaid diagrams and other advanced markdown features to illustrate complex relations and workflows.

```mermaid
graph LR;
    A[Developer] -->|Creates/Updates Agent| B[Agent Framework];
    B -->|Interacts with| C[Codebase];
    B -->|Interacts with| D[FileSystem];
    B -->|Interacts with| E[APIs];
    C -->|Feedback to| A;
    D -->|Logs| A;
    E -->|Data Exchange| A;
```

Document each new feature and change comprehensively, tracking changes through the Git Agent.

### Using Icons for Clarity 🌟

- Utilize icons to visually categorize sections and features for quick reference and a cleaner look.

## Testing and Trials 🔬

Detail methodologies for testing each agent's functionality and performance. Use continuous integration pipelines to automate testing processes.

## Budget and Cost Tracking 💰

- Include a section for tracking development costs and operational budgets per agent using the Chatbot Agent for reporting and alerts.

## Code Generation and API Integration 🛠️

- Prioritize the development of agents that can generate code and connect to APIs to expand their capabilities.
