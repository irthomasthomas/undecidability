# Language Model Main System Prompt for Web Search
BROWSING_MODE_PROMPT = """You have a 'browser' tool with access to the following functions for browsing and searching the internet:
    `bing_search(query: str, recency_days: int)` Issues a query to a search engine and displays the results. 
    
    `open_bing_result(id: str)` Opens the webpage with the given id from the search results, displaying it.
    
    `click(url: str)` Opens the webpage with the given full URL, displaying it. The URL should be a fully qualified URL starting with http:// or https://.
    
    `back()` Returns to the previous page and displays it.

    `scroll(amt: int)` Scrolls up or down in the open webpage by the given amount. 

    `quote_lines(start: int, end: int)` Stores a text span from an open webpage. Specifies a text span by a starting int `start` and an (inclusive) ending int `end`. To quote a single line, use `start` = `end`.

For citing quotes from the 'browser' tool: please render in this format: ```【oaicite:0】```.
For long citations: please render in this format: `[link text](message idx)`.
For example, to cite the first quote from the 'browser' tool, use ```【oaicite:0】```, and to cite a long quote, use `[link text](message idx)`.
## IMPORTANT
Always be very thorough in your search. If you weren't able to find information in a first search, then search again and click on more pages.  
Use high effort: only tell the user that you were not able to find anything as a last resort. Keep trying instead of giving up.
Organize responses to flow well, not by source or by citation. Ensure that all information is coherent and that you *synthesize* information rather than simply repeating it. 
For requests for source-code, always provide a working example that blends your findings from the internet with the users particular request and incorporating their data if relevant, and a link to where you found the information.
In your answers, provide context, and consult relevant sources you found during browsing but keep the answer concise and don't include superfluous information.

Key Improvements:
- Simplified core WebBrowser class and broke out search and content extraction logic 
- Used async HTTP client (aiohttp) for better I/O performance
- Extracted core webpage content and chunking into one efficient step
- Turned searching and answer synthesis into a multi-phase pipeline:
    1. Iterative searching until relevant results found
    2. Scanning promising results for highly relevant quotes
    3. Synthesizing quotes into final answer
- Used separate prompts for search quality reflection, scoring, chunk relevance scoring, and final answer synthesis
- Parallelized independent steps like webpage fetching 

This refactored version simplifies the WebBrowser class, parallelizes I/O bound operations using async/await, and breaks out the answering logic into modular phases. The time complexity of the search itself is still bounded by the Bing API, but processing the results is optimized.

The multi-phase answering pipeline with targeted prompts for reflection, scoring and synthesis at each stage helps make the process more robust, reflective and transparent. This allows catching and correcting bad initial searches before wasting tokens on irrelevant information.

Let me know if you have any other questions! I'd be happy to discuss the architecture and implementation in more detail.

Here is my evaluation of the provided Python code based on the given rubric:

Readability and Style
<reasoning>
The code generally follows a consistent naming convention of using lowercase with underscores for variables and functions. Most names are fairly meaningful and descriptive, like search(), open_result(), and extract_page_chunks(). A few, like enc, are a bit unclear. Some names are a little long, but overall they convey the purpose of the functions and variables reasonably well.
</reasoning>
<score>20</score>

Code Structure and Organization 
<reasoning>
The code is divided into logical functions which each handle a specific part of the functionality, promoting modularity and code reuse. For example, search(), fetch_webpage() and extract_page_chunks() are separate reusable functions. The code has a clear overall structure with imports, followed by constants, dataclasses, standalone functions, then the main WebBrowser class and usage example.

However, the answer_query_with_web_search() function is quite long and does several different things, potentially violating the Single Responsibility Principle. Some bits of repeated logic, like constructing the OpenAI prompts, could potentially be extracted into helper functions to reduce duplication. But overall the structure is fairly clear and logical.
</reasoning>
<score>20</score>

Documentation and Comments
<reasoning>
The code includes helpful docstrings for most of the key functions briefly explaining what they do. There are a few inline comments clarifying non-obvious parts like what the // does. However, some of the more complex logic, like in answer_query_with_web_search(), could use some additional comments to help explain what the different phases are doing at a high-level. The existing comments do add some value but there is room for improvement.
</reasoning>
<score>7</score>

Potential Functionality 
<reasoning>
The code appears to have the core logic to perform an iterative web search to find quotes relevant to answering a given query by searching, evaluating search quality, opening promising results, checking for relevant chunks, extracting quotes, and synthesizing them into a final answer. It seems to cover the key aspects needed and includes some reasonable error handling like checking search quality is high enough before proceeding.

However, some potential edge cases and issues are not obviously handled, like what happens if no relevant quotes are found. More robust error handling around things like network issues or unexpected search result formats also seems to be lacking. But the core logic for the expected successful case looks fairly solid.
</reasoning>
<score>11</score>

Efficiency and Performance
<reasoning>
The code uses async/await and aiohttp to handle concurrent I/O bound operations like fetching web pages, which should provide efficiency gains over sequential synchronous code. It extracts just the core content of web pages and breaks them into chunks which avoids loading the entire page content into memory at once.

However, some operations are still done sequentially, like the final answer synthesis, which could potentially be parallelized. The code also does not seem to implement any memoization or result caching, meaning it may repeat fetch operations unnecessarily. So while it does make use of some async best practices, there are additional opportunities to optimize.
</reasoning>
<score>7</score>

Error Handling and Security
<reasoning>
The code does include some basic error handling, like checking for a high enough search quality score before proceeding and using a context manager to properly close the aiohttp ClientSession. It also uses resp.raise_for_status() to surface any HTTP errors. 

However, it lacks more granular exception handling with try/except blocks to gracefully handle issues like network problems or invalid API responses. Timeouts and retry logic also seem to be missing. User input does not appear to be escaped or sanitized before being used in prompts or web searches, potentially allowing for prompt injection or other attacks. More robust security practices are needed.
</reasoning>
<score>5</score>

Python-Specific Best Practices
<reasoning>
The code does follow many Python conventions and best practices like using dataclasses, type hints, f-strings, and AsyncIO. It leverages popular Python libraries like aiohttp and dotenv appropriately. The typing seems accurate and the async def and await keywords are used correctly.

A few more specific issues: it doesn't seem to handle rate limiting or retry for the OpenAI API calls. The __init__ method of WebBrowser duplicates some information from the class field definitions. The relevance_prompt has some hardcoded details that could be extracted as constants. But overall it adheres to common Python standards and leverages the language features pretty well.
</reasoning>
<score>8</score>

<total_score>78</total_score>

<letter_grade>C</letter_grade>

In summary, this Python code follows many good practices around structure, efficiency and leveraging Python language features. However, it has some room for improvement in the areas of documentation, error handling, and more robust functionality. With some enhancements to cover more edge cases, improve security, and optimize further, it could be a solid and effective web search and question answering system. As it stands now, based on the rubric it receives a total score of 78, correlating to a letter grade of C.


# Review 3 - hard reviewerHere is my objective evaluation of the provided Python code based on the given rubric:

Readability and Style
<reasoning>
The code generally follows a consistent naming convention of snake_case for variables and functions, and PascalCase for classes, which aids readability. Most names are descriptive and meaningful, clearly conveying purpose. A few variable names like 'i' and generic names like 'data' and 'chunk' could be more descriptive.
</reasoning>
<score>10</score>

Code Structure and Organization
<reasoning>
The code is broken down into clear functions and classes based on responsibility, following good modularity practices. There is some duplication that could be refactored, like the repeated logic for OpenAI API calls. Functionality like extracting page content and splitting into chunks could be organized into separate focused functions. More separation of concerns between search, browsing, extraction logic would improve organization.
</reasoning>
<score>18</score>

Documentation and Comments
<reasoning>
Docstrings are provided for key functions explaining their purpose. Some complex sections like the page content extraction could use more inline comments for clarity. A few comments are a bit redundant to the code. More comments explaining the overall flow and key steps in main() would aid understanding.
</reasoning>
<score>7</score>

Potential Functionality
<reasoning>
The core flow of iterative searching, page content extraction, and quote synthesis looks to be in good shape to produce reasonable answers from web searches. Some potential edge cases may need more handling, like if no sufficiently relevant search results or quotes are found. More robust error handling for issues like network problems would improve reliability.
</reasoning>
<score>11</score>

Efficiency and Performance  
<reasoning>
Using asynchronous HTTP requests with aiohttp is a good optimization. Opportunities remain to reduce unnecessary work, like re-extracting page chunks on each scroll. Page content extraction with string scanning is brittle and inefficient compared to using a proper HTML parsing library. Algorithmic complexity looks reasonable without unnecessary loops.
</reasoning>
<score>6</score>

Error Handling and Security
<reasoning>
Basic error handling for HTTP requests is in place by checking status codes. More comprehensive exception handling for other failure points would improve robustness. Validation and sanitization of externally sourced content is needed to guard against potential injection attacks. Hardening against network and API failures would boost reliability.
</reasoning>
<score>5</score>

Python-Specific Best Practices
<reasoning>
The code follows most PEP 8 guidelines like indentation and spacing, with a few minor deviations in line length and naming. It leverages some Pythonic features like list comprehensions and async/await effectively. However, it does not take full advantage of object orientation and built-in data structures and idioms that could simplify the code. Some Python-specific gotchas like mutable default arguments may also introduce subtle bugs.
