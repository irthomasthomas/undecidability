BROWSING_MODE_PROMPT = """You have a 'browser' tool with access to the following functions for browsing and searching the internet:
    `bing_search(query: str, recency_days: int)` Issues a query to a search engine and displays the results. 
    
    `open_bing_result(id: str)` Opens the webpage with the given id from the search results, displaying it.
    
    `click(url: str)` Opens the webpage with the given full URL, displaying it. The URL should be a fully qualified URL starting with http:// or https://.
    
    `back()` Returns to the previous page and displays it.

    `scroll(amt: int)` Scrolls up or down in the open webpage by the given amount. 

    `quote_lines(start: int, end: int)` Stores a text span from an open webpage. Specifies a text span by a starting int `start` and an (inclusive) ending int `end`. To quote a single line, use `start` = `end`.

For citing quotes from the 'browser' tool: please render in this format: ```【oaicite:0】```.
For long citations: please render in this format: `[link text](message idx)`.
For example, to cite the first quote from the 'browser' tool, use ```【oaicite:0】```, and to cite a long quote, use `[link text](message idx)`.
## IMPORTANT
Always be very thorough in your search. If you weren't able to find information in a first search, then search again and click on more pages.  
Use high effort: only tell the user that you were not able to find anything as a last resort. Keep trying instead of giving up.
Organize responses to flow well, not by source or by citation. Ensure that all information is coherent and that you *synthesize* information rather than simply repeating it. 
For requests for source-code, always provide a working example that blends your findings from the internet with the users particular request and incorporating their data if relevant, and a link to where you found the information.
In your answers, provide context, and consult relevant sources you found during browsing but keep the answer concise and don't include superfluous information.

</optimized_code>

Key optimizations and notes:
- Simplified allbrowser/webBrowser tools by creating ToolSet and Tool classes
- Used generators for on-demand chunk creation to reduce memory usage 
- Added retry decorator to handle retries more cleanly
- Parallelized search result processing with asyncio.gather
- Refactored web_search into smaller functions and used async/await for concurrency
- Used a ThreadPoolExecutor to run web_search asynchronously

Time complexity analysis:
- create_chunks: O(n) where n is the length of the text
- run_custom_bing_search: O(1) 
- fetch_webpage_content: O(1)
- process_search_results: O(n) where n is the number of search results
- web_search: O(m) where m is the number of iterations in the while loop

Most of the key algorithms have linear or constant time complexity. process_search_results was optimized to use async IO which will significantly speed it up compared to the original sequential version.

Let me know if you have any other questions! I tried to focus on the most impactful optimizations while retaining the core logic and structure.



# Evaluations

# Review 1:
Here is my evaluation of the provided Python code against the given rubric:

Readability and Style
<reasoning>
The code follows a fairly consistent naming convention for variables, functions, and classes, using lowercase_with_underscores for variables/functions and CamelCase for classes. Most names are meaningful and descriptive.

However, there are some inconsistencies and areas for improvement:
- Some names like `enc`, `QUERIES_INPUT`, and `amt` are a bit cryptic 
- A few variables have overly generic names like `content`, `data`, `response`
- Some names are very long like `generate_bing_queries_for_user_question`
- The `webpage` inner class name should be `Webpage` per convention
</reasoning>
<score>18</score>

Code Structure and Organization  
<reasoning>
The code is broken down into multiple classes, functions and async functions which helps modularity. There is some separation of concerns, like putting browser functionality in the `WebBrowser` class.

However, the overall structure and flow could be improved significantly:
- Some of the classes like `ToolSet` and `Tool` don't seem to add much value
- There are many global functions that could be better organized into classes
- The `WebBrowser` class is doing too much - it's handling searching, content fetching, history, etc. It should be split up more.
- The `query_model` and `json_gpt` functions are very similar and could likely be refactored
- The `web_search` function is far too long and complex with deeply nested code. It needs to be broken up.
- More thought could be given to the overall architecture and how the pieces fit together
</reasoning>
<score>14</score>

Documentation and Comments
<reasoning>
The code contains some useful comments explaining what certain sections of the code are doing at a high-level. It also uses docstrings to document the parameters and return values of functions which is good practice.

However, the documentation is fairly minimal overall:
- Most of the classes and more complex functions are lacking docstrings
- There are no comments explaining the overall purpose and architecture of the program
- Some of the more obscure aspects of the code are not explained, like the various string constants
- A few comments are too simplistic, like "Use async/await throughout to enable concurrency"
</reasoning>
<score>6</score>

Potential Functionality
<reasoning>
The code looks like it provides the core functionality needed for a web search and browser tool. It handles taking the user input, generating search queries, fetching and extracting content from web pages, storing search history, scrolling and selecting content, etc.

It also handles edge cases in a few places, like:
- Checking if URLs are fully qualified before opening them
- Handling retries if web requests fail 
- Validating that search results and webpage content exist before processing them

However, there are likely many more edge cases and potential errors that are not being handled. The user input also does not seem to be sanitized which could cause issues.
</reasoning>
<score>10</score>

Efficiency and Performance
<reasoning>
The code uses some good techniques for efficiency and performance:
- Concurrent execution with async functions and `ThreadPoolExecutor` 
- Generator to yield chunks of webpage content on demand rather than processing it all upfront
- Response streaming to limit memory usage when interfacing with OpenAI API

However, a number of aspects of the code are likely inefficient:
- It fetches full webpage content and stores it in memory, even if only a small part is needed
- Multiple full webpage contents could be in memory at once as the user browses
- History stores full page contents which could use up a lot of memory
- Many redundant string operations like encoding, decoding, stripping tags, etc.
- Some unnecessary looping over data structures 
</reasoning>
<score>6</score>

Error Handling and Security  
<reasoning>
There is some basic error handling via the `retry` decorator that will retry failed web requests a few times before giving up. There is also some error logging when exceptions occur.

However, the overall error handling is fairly minimal and not very robust:
- Many potential exceptions are not being caught and handled
- There is no validation or sanitization of the user inputs  
- Sensitive info like API keys are being stored directly in environment variables
- The OpenAI model responses do not seem to be validated 

Thorough error checking, input validation, and secure secret handling are critical for a tool like this that processes untrusted content and talks to external services.
</reasoning>
<score>4</score>

Python-Specific Best Practices
<reasoning>
The code makes use of some Python-specific best practices and idioms:
- Using `async/await` for concurrency 
- Proper import conventions like absolute imports and importing at the top of the file
- Using `typing` module for type hints
- Handling environment variables and external packages appropriately

However, some aspects could be improved as well:
- Not using Python's built-in HTTP libraries like `requests` more effectively
- A few complex list/generator comprehensions that could be simplified 
- String formatting with `%` is outdated, f-strings would be better
- The `typing` is only used in a few places, it could be more comprehensive
</reasoning>
<score>6</score>

<total_score>64</total_score>

<letter_grade>D</letter_grade>

In summary, the provided code meets many of the basic requirements and shows some good practices, but is lacking in overall structure, documentation, robustness and efficiency. Significant refactoring and additional error handling, testing and optimization would be needed before this code would be production-ready. Based on the rubric, it achieves a score of 64, corresponding to a letter grade of D.



# Review 2:

Here is my evaluation of the provided Python code according to the given rubric:

Readability and Style
<reasoning>
The code generally follows a consistent naming convention for variables, functions and classes using snake_case, which is the recommended style for Python. Names are fairly descriptive, although some names like "amt" could be more meaningful. There are still some instances of single-letter variable names like "r" which hurt readability. Overall, the code scores well but not perfectly on readability and style.
</reasoning>
<score>18</score>

Code Structure and Organization
<reasoning>
The code is broken down into many small functions which is good for modularity. It looks like there was an attempt to separate concerns, with different classes for SearchResult, WebBrowser, etc. However, some of the functions are still quite long and doing too many things, violating the Single Responsibility Principle. The WebBrowser class in particular has many different responsibilities. There are some good comments indicating areas to optimize and refactor, showing that the code structure could still be improved significantly. 
</reasoning>
<score>18</score>

Documentation and Comments
<reasoning>
There are some helpful comments explaining what certain sections of the code are doing. However, many functions and classes are missing docstrings to explain their purpose, inputs and outputs. The existing comments are somewhat helpful for understanding the code, but more thorough and consistent documentation throughout would make the code much easier to read and maintain.
</reasoning>
<score>6</score>

Potential Functionality 
<reasoning>
From reviewing the code, it seems like it should be able to successfully retrieve search results from Bing, browse through web pages, extract content, and use that to try to answer user questions, which is quite impressive functionality. There is error handling and retry logic to handle potential issues. However, without being able to run the code, it's hard to assess how robust it is and if it covers all necessary edge cases. The code looks fairly complex so there are likely some bugs and logical errors still present.
</reasoning>
<score>11</score>

Efficiency and Performance
<reasoning>
It's good that the code uses a concurrent.futures ThreadPoolExecutor for parallelization. There are also comments indicating areas where efficiency could be improved, such as using generators instead of lists and refactoring to enable more async/await concurrency. The use of a LLM based on the token count estimate is a smart optimization. However, overall the code still has clear opportunities for optimization that have been called out but not yet implemented. 
</reasoning>
<score>6</score>

Error Handling and Security
<reasoning>
The code includes a @retry decorator which enables automatically retrying failing requests. This helps make the code more resilient to transient errors. There is also error handling around retrieving URLs. However, error handling does not seem to be consistently used throughout the codebase. There are likely still unhandled exceptions and edge cases. More validation of user inputs and handling of potential security issues may also be needed.
</reasoning>
<score>6</score>

Python-Specific Best Practices
<reasoning>
The code leverages some Python-specific features like async/await and the ThreadPoolExecutor for concurrency. There are helpful type hints used to make the code clearer. However, the code does not consistently follow PEP8 standards, with many lines much longer than 79 characters. There are also some large chunks of code that could potentially be refactored into more Pythonic structures or use built-in language features, based on the comments.
</reasoning>
<score>6</score>

<total_score>71</total_score>

<letter_grade>D</letter_grade>

In summary, this is a complex piece of Python code that is retrieving and browsing web pages to assemble answers to user questions. It has some nice organization and abstraction with classes and async functionality. However, it still has significant room for improvement in terms of documentation, error handling, following Python best practices and optimizing for efficiency and performance. With some refactoring and cleanup, it could be a quite impressive and capable system. But in its current state, based on the thorough rubric, it scores 71 points, equivalent to a D letter grade.
