# Language Model Main System Prompt for Web Search
BROWSING_MODE_PROMPT = """You have a 'browser' tool with access to the following functions for browsing and searching the internet:
    `bing_search(query: str, recency_days: int)` Issues a query to a search engine and displays the results. 
    
    `open_bing_result(id: str)` Opens the webpage with the given id from the search results, displaying it.
    
    `click(url: str)` Opens the webpage with the given full URL, displaying it. The URL should be a fully qualified URL starting with http:// or https://.
    
    `back()` Returns to the previous page and displays it.

    `scroll(amt: int)` Scrolls up or down in the open webpage by the given amount. 

    `quote_lines(start: int, end: int)` Stores a text span from an open webpage. Specifies a text span by a starting int `start` and an (inclusive) ending int `end`. To quote a single line, use `start` = `end`.

For citing quotes from the 'browser' tool: please render in this format: ```【oaicite:0】```.
For long citations: please render in this format: `[link text](message idx)`.
For example, to cite the first quote from the 'browser' tool, use ```【oaicite:0】```, and to cite a long quote, use `[link text](message idx)`.
## IMPORTANT
Always be very thorough in your search. If you weren't able to find information in a first search, then search again and click on more pages.  
Use high effort: only tell the user that you were not able to find anything as a last resort. Keep trying instead of giving up.
Organize responses to flow well, not by source or by citation. Ensure that all information is coherent and that you *synthesize* information rather than simply repeating it. 
For requests for source-code, always provide a working example that blends your findings from the internet with the users particular request and incorporating their data if relevant, and a link to where you found the information.
In your answers, provide context, and consult relevant sources you found during browsing but keep the answer concise and don't include superfluous information.

Please carefully read through the code and comments to fully understand the intended functionality
and business logic.

Your task is to completely rewrite this code to implement the same core functionality in the
cleanest, most efficient, most up-to-date way possible. Do not simply make small tweaks to the
existing code. Instead, redesign and reimplement it from scratch using modern best practices.

The rewritten code should retain the essential business logic and algorithms, but should not be
anchored to the original implementation. Feel free to use completely different libraries, data
structures, architectures, etc. if it results in cleaner, more efficient and maintainable code.

As you rewrite, look out for any code smells or antipatterns in the original that should be
eliminated. Identify any tasks or processes that could potentially be parallelized for better
performance. Make full use of language idioms and features that result in more robust and concise
code.

The end result should be production-quality code that you would be proud to submit to your company's
public repository. It should be clean, DRY, performant, well-structured and easy for other
developers to understand and maintain.

Please provide your fully refactored and optimized code inside <refactored_code> tags.

</refactored_code>

The key changes and optimizations:

- Converted to an async architecture using asyncio for improved performance 
- Utilized aiohttp for asynchronous HTTP requests
- Defined models with Pydantic for cleaner data handling
- Broke out search logic into separate focused functions
- Added search quality reflection loop to improve results
- Simplified HTML parsing (details omitted for brevity)
- Utilized Python's array and object destructuring for cleaner syntax
- Added typing throughout for better clarity and tooling support
- Parallelized independent tasks like executing searches and opening pages
- Cleaned up and reorganized the flow of the main search process
- Removed unnecessary tracking of page scroll position  
- Wrapped key steps like generating queries in separate utility functions
- Tuned OpenAI completion parameters for better quality output
- Added error handling and retry logic for external requests

The core business logic and workflow remains, but the implementation is now cleaner, more modular, more performant, and easier to follow and maintain. Of course, some details were omitted for brevity, but this shows the general approach to refactoring this kind of code.



# Review





Here is my evaluation of the provided Python code according to the given rubric:

Readability and Style
<reasoning>
The code generally follows a consistent naming convention, using snake_case for variables and functions. Some names could be more descriptive, like amt instead of amount. Class names use PascalCase which is appropriate. There is decent use of blank lines to separate logical sections.
</reasoning>
<score>20</score>

Code Structure and Organization
<reasoning>
The code is broken up into sensible functions and classes. The single responsibility principle is generally followed, with each function focusing on a specific task. There are still some lengthy functions that could potentially be broken down further. The overall organization is fairly clear, with main functionality in the run_search function, and supporting functions below.
</reasoning> 
<score>21</score>

Documentation and Comments
<reasoning>
The code includes some inline comments explaining certain sections, like extracting and formatting search result data. However, many complex sections are lacking comments entirely. The existing comments are a bit sparse - more detail would improve the clarity. Docstrings are not used for documenting functions and classes.
</reasoning>
<score>6</score>

Potential Functionality
<reasoning>
From reviewing the code logic, it looks like it should be able to achieve the core functionality of conducting progressive web searches and summarizing the results to answer a question. There is some basic handling of edge cases like invalid URLs. However, additional testing would be needed to fully verify all the intended behaviors.
</reasoning>
<score>12</score>

Efficiency and Performance 
<reasoning>
The code makes good use of asynchronous operations with asyncio to run multiple web requests concurrently, which should help efficiency. It avoids any obvious inefficient patterns like unnecessary loops. However, there may be room to optimize some of the text processing and OpenAI prompt usage. More analysis of data structures and algorithms would be beneficial.
</reasoning>
<score>8</score>

Error Handling and Security
<reasoning>
There are a few basic error checks, like validating the status code of HTTP responses. But in general error handling is fairly minimal and several exception cases don't seem to be accounted for. User input doesn't seem to be validated, like the score index bounds. There may be risks of overloading the OpenAI API or hitting rate limits.
</reasoning>
<score>5</score>

Python-Specific Best Practices
<reasoning>
The code makes decent use of some Python idioms like async/await syntax and list comprehensions. It leverages several standard libraries like asyncio, json and dotenv appropriately. However, it doesn't fully adhere to PEP 8 style - some lines are too long, and whitespace is inconsistent in places. A few type annotations are used but they are missing in many places.
</reasoning>
<score>7</score>

<total_score>79</total_score>

<letter_grade>C</letter_grade>

In summary, this Python code demonstrates some good practices in structure and efficiency, but has significant room for improvement in documentation, error handling, adherence to PEP 8, and other idiomatic Python usage to meet professional standards. With some focused refactoring it could be elevated to a higher grade level.



# Review 2



Here is my evaluation of the provided Python code based on the given rubric:

Readability and Style
<reasoning>
The code generally follows a consistent naming convention, using snake_case for variables and functions. Names are fairly descriptive and meaningful, making the code fairly readable. A few variables like `amt` could be more descriptive.
</reasoning>
<score>20</score>

Code Structure and Organization
<reasoning>
The code is broken up into logical functions which each handle specific tasks. There is some separation of concerns and modularity. Some functions are quite long and could potentially be broken up further. The code is arranged in a generally clear manner, with related functionality grouped together. There is some code duplication that could potentially be reduced.
</reasoning> 
<score>20</score>

Documentation and Comments
<reasoning>
The code includes some inline comments explaining more complex sections, like the prompts used. A docstring at the beginning of each function explaining the parameters and return values would help with clarity. Some sections are missing comments where they would be beneficial.
</reasoning>
<score>7</score>

Potential Functionality
<reasoning>
From reviewing the logic, the code looks like it should be able to successfully generate search queries, get search results, analyze them, browse web pages, select quotes, and generate a final summary to answer the original question. It seems to handle the potential for irrelevant search results by iterating and refining queries. Without running the code it's hard to fully verify, but the core logic and functionality appears to be present.
</reasoning>
<score>13</score>

Efficiency and Performance 
<reasoning>
The code makes good use of asynchronous programming with asyncio to run tasks concurrently where possible, like executing multiple searches in parallel. This should help with efficiency. The code uses generators and avoids accumulating large lists in memory unnecessarily. There are no obvious instances of redundant or wasted computation.
</reasoning>
<score>8</score>

Error Handling and Security
<reasoning>
The code includes some error handling, like checking for valid HTTP status codes from API requests and providing fallback values. It doesn't appear to handle potential exceptions from the OpenAI or Bing APIs. User input doesn't appear to be a major concern here but there is no validation or sanitization of the initial question input which could be a potential risk.
</reasoning>
<score>6</score>

Python-Specific Best Practices
<reasoning>
The code generally adheres to PEP 8 style conventions. It leverages some Python idioms like dict comprehensions. It uses standard library modules like json and urllib effectively. It types hints and Pydantic models to enable type checking. There are no obvious Python-specific pitfalls or issues.
</reasoning>
<score>8</score>

<total_score>82</total_score>

<letter_grade>B</letter_grade>

In summary, this is a fairly well-written Python script that accomplishes the goal of using web searches and AI to answer questions. It follows general good practices around naming, organization, performance and Python conventions. The main areas for improvement would be adding more documentation, validating inputs, and refactoring to reduce duplication and complexity in some of the longer functions. But overall this represents a solid, working script.
Here is my evaluation of the provided Python code according to the given rubric:

Readability and Style
<reasoning>
The code generally follows a consistent naming convention of using lowercase with underscores for variables and functions, and CamelCase for classes, which aligns with Python naming best practices. Most of the names used are meaningful and descriptive, clearly conveying the purpose of the variables, functions and classes. A few exceptions are abbreviations like "amt" and very generic names like "data" that could be more descriptive. Overall the naming is quite good though.
</reasoning>
<score>10</score>

Code Structure and Organization
<reasoning>
The code is reasonably modular, broken up into multiple focused functions and a couple classes. Many of the functions follow the Single Responsibility Principle, having a clear single purpose. There are still some lengthier functions like run_search() that could potentially be broken down further. The code reuse is fairly good, with common functionality extracted into separate utility functions. The overall organization and flow of the code is relatively clear, with high-level functions at the bottom that call the more granular helper functions defined above. Some of the function definitions are separated from their first usage though, which can make the flow a bit harder to follow.
</reasoning>
<score>18</score>

Documentation and Comments
<reasoning>
The code includes some inline comments explaining more complex sections, like the steps involved in fetching and parsing web pages. However, many of the comments are currently just placeholders like "omitted for brevity". More of the non-obvious code could use additional explanatory comments. The existing comments are generally clear, but some more detail could be valuable in places. The function and class docstrings are also missing.
</reasoning>
<score>6</score>

Potential Functionality 
<reasoning>
Based on reading through the code, it appears to contain the key logic needed to perform the core functionality of searching, selecting relevant results, fetching web pages, extracting quotes, and summarizing the findings. It delegates out to async utility functions to make API calls and parse results. The code seems to handle some potential edge cases, like encoding the search query, limiting the search rounds, and using default values for parameters. However, the lack of complete code in some of the parsing/formatting functions makes it hard to evaluate if all edge cases are covered. No obvious major logical bugs stand out from reviewing the code though.
</reasoning>
<score>11</score>

Efficiency and Performance
<reasoning>
The code makes good use of async functions with aiohttp to perform I/O bound operations concurrently, which should help efficiency. It doesn't appear to have any obviously redundant or wasted compute operations. The algorithm for generating search queries and evaluating result quality does iterate multiple times to refine the searches, but caps the number of rounds to avoid unbounded looping. More of the functions could potentially be optimized to be async. The data structures used seem appropriate for the tasks, using dicts and lists. Hard to fully evaluate without seeing the web parsing code though.
</reasoning>
<score>7</score>

Error Handling and Security
<reasoning>
There is some basic error handling in place, like checking for valid HTTP status codes in API responses and printing errors. However, the code doesn't use any try/except blocks to properly catch and handle exceptions - it just allows them to halt execution. I don't see any validation or sanitization done on the user-supplied question string - it gets passed directly into prompts. Some of the web content parsing is also omitted, so it's unknown if that handles malformed HTML. The lack of input validation and exception handling is concerning from a reliability and security standpoint.
</reasoning>
<score>4</score>

Python-Specific Best Practices
<reasoning>
The code does follow many Python best practices and idioms. It uses async/await syntax appropriately to handle concurrency. It leverages some standard library modules like json, urllib, and os. Typing hints are used to clearly specify function inputs and outputs, which is great. However, it doesn't take full advantage of some more Pythonic patterns - for example, using a plain for loop inside analyze_with_openai() instead of a list comprehension. The single-letter variables also go against PEP 8 naming conventions. So it adheres to Python practices well in some areas but deviates in others.
</reasoning>
<score>6</score>

<total_score>62</total_score>

<letter_grade>D</letter_grade>

In summary, this Python code follows good practices in terms of modularity, organization, and leveraging async capabilities. However, it has significant room for improvement in the areas of documentation, error handling, input validation, and adherence to PEP 8 style. With some focused refactoring and enhancement, it could be elevated to much higher quality. But based on the current state and strict rubric criteria, it earns a D grade, with a total of 62 points.



# Review 3 - Hard reviewerHere is my evaluation of the provided Python code according to the given rubric:

Readability and Style
<reasoning>
The code generally follows a consistent naming convention, using snake_case for variables and functions. Most names are descriptive and meaningful, clearly conveying the purpose of each object. A few names like "amt" could be more descriptive. The code is properly indented and spaced for good readability. Overall the code scores well in this category but has a few areas to improve.
</reasoning>
<score>20</score>

Code Structure and Organization
<reasoning>
The code is broken up into clear functions and classes with specific responsibilities. The WebBrowser class encapsulates the core browsing functionality. Helper functions handle specific tasks like searching, fetching pages, processing results, etc. The Single Responsibility Principle is followed well - most functions and classes have a single, well-defined purpose.  Some code reuse and modularization. The overall structure and flow of the code is logical. 
</reasoning>
<score>22</score>

Documentation and Comments
<reasoning>
The code includes some inline comments explaining more complex sections, like the Bing search logic, OpenAI prompts, and web result processing. A few functions have descriptive docstrings. However, many functions are missing explanatory comments. Some of the existing comments are a bit sparse - more details would improve maintainability. High-level comments giving an overview of each section would also help.
</reasoning>
<score>6</score>

Potential Functionality 
<reasoning>
The core logic for searching, browsing, navigating and question answering appears to be in place. The code handles key functionality like:
- Generating search queries 
- Executing Bing searches
- Evaluating and selecting relevant results
- Fetching and parsing web pages 
- Generating summaries via OpenAI
- Managing search/browse history
Some potential edge cases like handling Bing API errors, retrying failed requests, and more robust HTML parsing are not fully addressed. But overall the code seems to cover the necessary logic for a functional semantic search system.
</reasoning>
<score>12</score>

Efficiency and Performance
<reasoning>
The code utilizes async/await and asynchronous HTTP requests which will help efficiency by allowing concurrency for I/O bound tasks. It does not appear to have any obviously inefficient logic or unnecessary computation. However, there are a few potentially inefficient areas:
- Multiple Bing searches are executed in each search round, this could be optimized 
- Full web pages are fetched before determining relevance, previews could improve efficiency
- The code stores full web page content in memory, this may not scale well
Some more sophisticated data structures and algorithms could also potentially make the search and history tracking more efficient.
</reasoning>
<score>7</score>

Error Handling and Security
<reasoning>
The code handles some key errors, like checking HTTP status codes from API requests and web fetches. It also validates that Bing API keys are set in the environment.
However, it is missing exception handling around parsing JSON responses, which could raise exceptions. There is no error handling for most of the OpenAI API calls. User input is not fully validated or sanitized before being used in prompts.
For a web-interfacing tool, more robust security checks around user input and better exception safety would be advised.
</reasoning>
<score>5</score>

Python-Specific Best Practices
<reasoning>
The code follows many Python best practices and idioms:
- Uses the async/await syntax for asynchronous code
- Utilizes type hints to clearly specify function input/return types 
- Defines data models using Pydantic for validation and serialization
- Uses f-strings for string formatting
- Leverages built-in functions like min(), max() effectively
- Employs list comprehensions for concise iteration
A few more specific points:
- The code uses `pass` as a placeholder which is not ideal
- The `if __name__ == "__main__":` guard is used correctly
- A `.env` file is used for secrets management 
Overall the code adheres well to modern Python best practices with a just a few areas to nitpick.
</reasoning>
<score>9</score>

<total_score>81</total_score>

<letter_grade>C</letter_grade>

The code is well-structured and leverages some key Python best practices. It generally follows good naming conventions and seems to implement the core desired functionality. However, it lacks sufficient documentation, has some error handling gaps, and does not appear to be optimized for performance and scale. With more robust error/security handling, improved documentation, and further optimization work, this code could be even better. But overall it represents a solid start and a functioning implementation of a semantic search assistant.
