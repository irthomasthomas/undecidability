# Language Model Main System Prompt for Web Search
BROWSING_MODE_PROMPT = """You have a 'browser' tool with access to the following functions for browsing and searching the internet:
    `bing_search(query: str, recency_days: int)` Issues a query to a search engine and displays the results. 
    
    `open_bing_result(id: str)` Opens the webpage with the given id from the search results, displaying it.
    
    `click(url: str)` Opens the webpage with the given full URL, displaying it. The URL should be a fully qualified URL starting with http:// or https://.
    
    `back()` Returns to the previous page and displays it.

    `scroll(amt: int)` Scrolls up or down in the open webpage by the given amount. 

    `quote_lines(start: int, end: int)` Stores a text span from an open webpage. Specifies a text span by a starting int `start` and an (inclusive) ending int `end`. To quote a single line, use `start` = `end`.

For citing quotes from the 'browser' tool: please render in this format: ```【oaicite:0】```.
For long citations: please render in this format: `[link text](message idx)`.
For example, to cite the first quote from the 'browser' tool, use ```【oaicite:0】```, and to cite a long quote, use `[link text](message idx)`.
## IMPORTANT
Always be very thorough in your search. If you weren't able to find information in a first search, then search again and click on more pages.  
Use high effort: only tell the user that you were not able to find anything as a last resort. Keep trying instead of giving up.
Organize responses to flow well, not by source or by citation. Ensure that all information is coherent and that you *synthesize* information rather than simply repeating it. 
For requests for source-code, always provide a working example that blends your findings from the internet with the users particular request and incorporating their data if relevant, and a link to where you found the information.
In your answers, provide context, and consult relevant sources you found during browsing but keep the answer concise and don't include superfluous information.

Please carefully read through the provided source code and code comments to fully understand the
intended functionality and core business logic that needs to be retained.

Before refactoring the code, think through your approach in a <scratchpad>. Consider the following
as you plan the refactoring:
- Are there opportunities to update the code to use more modern, efficient methods, libraries or
language features?
- How can the code structure, readability and maintainability be improved?
- Do you notice any code smells, antipatterns or other issues that should be addressed?
- Are there any performance optimizations that can be made, including parallelizing tasks if
possible?
- Look for any repetition and aim to refactor to adhere to DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself) principles
- Make sure that the core business logic and essential algorithms are retained, even as the
implementation is updated

Once you've thought through the refactoring approach, please implement your updated version of the
code that addresses the considerations outlined above. Aim to write clean, efficient, maintainable
code that you would be proud to contribute to a company's public codebase.

Please output the full refactored code inside <refactored_code> tags.

</refactored_code>

Key changes:

1. Simplified the `WebBrowser` class by using Lists to store search results and page text instead of custom classes. Removed unused methods and attributes.

2. Used aiohttp and asyncio to make web requests asynchronous, improving performance. Refactored methods that make web requests to be async.

3. Extracted prompts and other constants to module level variables to improve readability. 

4. Simplified the browser tool definitions using a loop and dictionary.

5. Updated the `query_model` function to use exponential backoff when retrying after rate limit errors.

6. Refactored `generate_bing_queries` to use the OpenAI API directly and simplify the prompt. Extracted it to a separate function.

7. In `web_search`, flattened the search results into a single list and used asyncio.gather to perform searches concurrently.

8. Removed the separate logic for selecting a model based on token count, instead always using gpt-3.5-turbo unless the token count is too high.

9. Added a `truncate` utility function and used it to truncate long messages to avoid exceeding token limits.

10. Simplified the parsing and handling of tool calls in the main loop.

11. Used f-strings and descriptive variable names to improve readability.

12. Moved the main logic into an async `main` function and used `asyncio.run` to execute it.

The core business logic and essential algorithms are retained, but the implementation has been updated to be more efficient, readable, and maintainable. Repetitive code has been refactored to adhere to DRY principles. The use of async and await allows for better performance through concurrency.




# Review



Here is my evaluation of the provided Python code according to the given rubric:

Readability and Style
<reasoning>
The code generally follows a consistent naming convention, using lower_case_with_underscores for variables and functions, and PascalCase for classes, which adheres to Python style guidelines. Most of the names are meaningful and descriptive, clearly conveying the purpose of the variable or function. A few names like "amt" could be more descriptive.
</reasoning>
<score>20</score>

Code Structure and Organization
<reasoning>
The code is broken down into reasonably sized functions and classes, each handling a specific responsibility. For example, the WebBrowser class encapsulates browser-related functionality. However, the main() function is doing a lot and could potentially be broken down further. The code is organized in a logical sequence and avoids excessive duplication. Use of async functions is a good design choice for I/O bound operations.
</reasoning> 
<score>22</score>

Documentation and Comments
<reasoning>
The code includes some helpful docstrings and inline comments explaining key aspects, but there are many complex sections that could use more detailed explanations, such as the tool definitions and prompt setup in query_model(). Additional high-level documentation about the overall purpose and architecture of the program would enhance maintainability.
</reasoning>
<score>6</score>

Potential Functionality
<reasoning>
The code appears to have the necessary components to achieve its goal of performing web searches and answering user questions by browsing top results. It handles the core flow of generating search queries, fetching result pages, extracting content, and facilitating navigation. However, more extensive testing would be needed to verify if it produces quality answers and handles edge cases robustly. Some potential gaps are around optimal keyword generation, search quality reflection, and synthesizing the most relevant parts of articles into a coherent final response.
</reasoning>
<score>11</score>

Efficiency and Performance  
<reasoning>
The code utilizes asyncio to run I/O tasks concurrently, which will help efficiency. It avoids any obviously inefficient patterns like unnecessary loops or O(n^2) operations. However, recursively searching until an answer is found could potentially lead to an excessive number of requests. Caching search results and extracted page content could help reduce redundant fetching. More analysis of the token count estimation logic and OpenAI model selection would be beneficial to optimize performance and cost.
</reasoning>
<score>7</score>

Error Handling and Security  
<reasoning>
The code includes some basic error handling, such as the try/except around parsing the JSON search queries, and the retry logic when OpenAI rate limits are hit. However, more comprehensive error handling is lacking - there are many places where exceptions could occur but are not being caught and handled, such as network errors during fetch requests, OpenAI API errors, or invalid user input. Minimal security best practices like input validation are not implemented.

<letter_grade>C</letter_grade>

In summary, this Python code follows many best practices around style, organization, and leveraging Python language features effectively. However, the lack of comprehensive error handling, gaps in documentation, and room for performance optimizations bring the overall grade down to a C based on the provided rubric. With some enhancements to make the code more robust, efficient and maintainable, it could move into the B or A range.
Here is my evaluation of the provided Python code according to the given rubric:

Readability and Style
<reasoning>
The code generally follows a consistent naming convention, using snake_case for variables and functions. Some names like `enc` could be more descriptive. Class names properly use PascalCase. Names are fairly meaningful overall.
</reasoning>
<score>20</score>

Code Structure and Organization
<reasoning>
The code is broken down into reasonably-sized functions and classes, showing good modularity. The `WebBrowser` class encapsulates web-related functionality well. Functions mostly follow the Single Responsibility Principle, though some like `web_search` are a bit long. There is minimal duplication. Code is organized logically, with imports, globals, classes and standalone functions grouped together.
</reasoning> 
<score>21</score>

Documentation and Comments
<reasoning>
The code includes some helpful docstrings and inline comments explaining key functionality. However, many complex sections like the `web_search` and `query_model` functions lack detailed explanations for what the code is doing. More comments would help with readability and maintainability.
</reasoning>
<score>6</score>

Potential Functionality
<reasoning>
The code looks like it would achieve the core functionality of a conversational AI agent that can browse the web to find information to answer questions. Key components like web searching, extracting page text, chunking, scrolling, and quoting are implemented. The retry logic and token counting for the LLM query indicates handling of practical considerations and edge cases. Without running the code, no obvious logical bugs jump out, though more error handling may be beneficial.
</reasoning>
<score>13</score>

Efficiency and Performance
<reasoning>
The code utilizes async functions and performs operations like web requests concurrently, which helps efficiency. It attempts to minimize unnecessary API calls by generating search queries carefully. Chunking page text and estimating LLM tokens shows attention to memory usage. However, the code could potentially make many API calls in complex queries, and storing full page text in memory may not scale well.
</reasoning>
<score>7</score>

Error Handling and Security
<reasoning>
The core LLM querying includes retry logic to handle rate limiting errors. Some basic checks for null responses are made. However, much of the code lacks robust error handling, and many potential exceptions are uncaught. Security issues are partially addressed by extracting page scripts and styles that could contain malicious content. However, there is no explicit sanitization or validation of untrusted web content and user input. More comprehensive security measures would be advisable.
</reasoning>
<score>5</score>

Python-Specific Best Practices
<reasoning>
The code follows most PEP 8 guidelines, with consistent indentation and line lengths. Key Python features like type hints, async/await, list comprehensions, and f-strings are leveraged. The standard library is used for common tasks like web requests, HTML parsing, and JSON. Classes and built-ins like dict and list are used appropriately. A couple potential issues like mutable default args are present but minor overall.
</reasoning>

<letter_grade>B</letter_grade>

In summary, this is a functional and generally well-structured Python codebase that utilizes language features and third-party libraries effectively to implement a conversational web search agent. The main areas for improvement are more comprehensive error handling, security considerations, efficiency at scale, and more thorough documentation. With some enhancements, this could be a robust and maintainable foundation.
Here is my evaluation of the provided Python code based on the given rubric:

Readability and Style
<reasoning>
The code generally follows a consistent naming convention, using lowercase_with_underscores for variables and functions, and PascalCase for classes, which adheres to Python naming guidelines. Most of the names are meaningful and descriptive, clearly conveying the purpose of the variables, functions and classes. A few names like "amt" could be more descriptive.
</reasoning>
<score>22</score>

Code Structure and Organization
<reasoning>
The code is broken down into small, focused functions and classes, each handling a specific responsibility. This shows good modularity and separation of concerns. The WebBrowser class encapsulates the browser-related functionality well. There is minimal code duplication. The code is mostly organized in a logical sequence, although the _fetch_page_text function is defined after it is used. 
</reasoning>
<score>23</score>

Documentation and Comments
<reasoning>
The code includes some comments explaining more complex sections, like the exponential backoff retry logic. However, many of the functions and classes are lacking docstrings to describe their purpose, parameters and return values. More comments throughout the code explaining the flow and key operations would enhance the code's readability and maintainability.
</reasoning>
<score>7</score>

Potential Functionality
<reasoning>
The code appears to contain the core logic to perform web searching, browsing, scrolling and text selection based on the defined functions. It handles the main success path for finding relevant information to answer user questions. However, it's hard to assess how robust the error and edge case handling is without further testing. The code may need additional checks around handling and parsing the web page content and model responses.
</reasoning>
<score>12</score>

Efficiency and Performance  
<reasoning>
The code uses asynchronous operations (async/await) for web requests, which is an efficient approach to handle the I/O bound operations of fetching web pages. The code also tries to avoid unnecessary computations by returning early in some cases. However, the multiple retries upon rate limiting could be optimized further - the delay doesn't take into account when the rate limit period actually resets. The code could also potentially process and send data to the model in smaller batches instead of one large request.
</reasoning>
<score>8</score>

Error Handling and Security
<reasoning>
The code includes some error handling, like the retry logic for rate limiting errors from the OpenAI API and default values when parsing certain responses. It also handles potential JSON parsing errors. However, the error handling is not comprehensive - many of the web requests and API calls lack proper exception handling. The code does not include input validation or sanitization which could make it susceptible to issues like XSS if user-supplied URLs are opened.
</reasoning>  
<score>6</score>

Python-Specific Best Practices
<reasoning>
The code follows many Python best practices and idioms, such as using list comprehensions, f-strings, generator expressions and context managers for resource handling. It leverages core Python libraries like asyncio and popular third-party libraries in the Python ecosystem like aiohttp and BeautifulSoup. The code is structured according to PEP8 guidelines, although some lines exceed the recommended line length. Type hints are used effectively, but some types are overly broad (like Union[str, int]).
</reasoning>
<score>8</score>

<total_score>86</total_score>

<letter_grade>B</letter_grade>

In summary, the code is well-structured and uses Python idioms effectively, but would benefit from more thorough documentation, error handling and input validation. With some optimization and hardening against edge cases, this could move from a B to an A level Python submission.


# Review 2 - Hard reviewerHere is my objective evaluation of the provided code based on the given rubric:

Readability and Style
<reasoning>
The code mostly follows the Python naming conventions of lowercase with underscores for variables and functions, and PascalCase for classes. However, some variable names like "enc" and "amt" are too short and not very descriptive. While most of the names are somewhat meaningful, they could be more precise, like "page_lines" instead of just "lines".

The use of vertical whitespace is inconsistent - in some places there are multiple blank lines (like after the imports), while in other places (like inside functions) the code is more dense. Following PEP 8 guidelines around vertical whitespace more strictly would improve readability.

Some lines are quite long (>100 characters), which can hurt readability, especially when there are complex list/dict comprehensions. Using more intermediate variables or breaking long lines into multiple shorter lines would help.
</reasoning>
<score>16</score>

Code Structure and Organization  
<reasoning>
The code shows some good organizational practices, like putting imports at the top, grouping related functionality into classes (WebBrowser), and breaking out some reusable logic into standalone functions (truncate, generate_bing_queries, etc).

However, the WebBrowser class is doing a lot and has some responsibilities that could be extracted to separate classes or modules, like the actual fetching and parsing of web pages. The query_model function is also quite complex, handling both the OpenAI API call and the parsing of the response - this could be broken down further.

There is some duplication that could be reduced - for example, the logic for handling each type of tool call in web_search involves a lot of repeated if/elif checks and similar code for appending to messages. This could likely be refactored to be more DRY.

The ordering of functions is a bit confusing - some are defined after they are used (like _fetch_page_text). Organizing functions in the order they are called or grouping related functions together would improve clarity.
</reasoning>
<score>17</score>

Documentation and Comments
<reasoning>
The code has very few comments, and the ones that exist are quite minimal, like "Flatten list". There are no docstrings explaining what each function or class does, what parameters it takes, or what it returns. 

For a complex program like this with many moving parts, the lack of thorough documentation makes it harder to understand the code flow and intent. Key design decisions, trade-offs, and assumptions should be documented. 

Complex pieces of logic, like the prompt generation in generate_bing_queries or the exponential backoff in query_model, particularly warrant explanation.

Without sufficient documentation, maintaining and modifying this code will be challenging, especially for developers who are new to the codebase.
</reasoning>
<score>3</score>

Potential Functionality
<reasoning>
From reviewing the code, it seems to cover the core components needed for a web-searching question-answering assistant: generating search queries, fetching and parsing web pages, extracting relevant content, and utilizing an OpenAI language model to interpret the results and generate responses.

However, without being able to run the code and test it on various inputs, it's hard to assess how robust and reliable it is. There are several areas where functionality issues could arise:

- The search query generation relies on the LLM to produce well-formed JSON arrays, but there is no validation that the output is actually in the expected format. Malformed responses could cause errors.

- The web scraping using BeautifulSoup is quite basic - it extracts all the text, but doesn't handle things like page structure, navigation menus, ads, etc very intelligently. For more complex pages, irrelevant content may be included.

- The chunking of text is done by simple character limits, which may not always produce coherent excerpts. Splitting on sentence boundaries would be better.

- There is no tracking of which pages have already been searched, so the assistant may waste time re-searching the same sources.

- The stopping criteria for when the assistant has found enough information to answer the question is not clearly defined.

More extensive testing would be needed to verify the end-to-end functionality and assess the quality of the generated answers.
</reasoning>
<score>10</score>

Efficiency and Performance
<reasoning>
The use of asynchronous functions (with asyncio and aiohttp) for making web requests is a good optimization - this allows the program to efficiently fetch multiple pages concurrently without blocking.

The exponential backoff retry logic when hitting rate limits is also a nice performance touch, helping the program gracefully handle temporary failures without giving up too quickly.

However, there are several areas where efficiency could be improved:

- The search results and page contents are stored as in-memory lists, which may not scale well for very large numbers of searches or long pages. Using a database or at least caching to disk could help.

- Each invocation of the model reprocesses all the previous messages, which becomes increasingly expensive as the conversation gets longer. Pruning earlier messages or summarization could help keep this manageable.

- Retrying the entire search every time the model does something unexpected (like not producing a tool call) is wasteful. A more targeted retry or forward recovery mechanism would be better.

- The token counting and model selection logic could be optimized further - checking length for every single message may be excessive. More sophisticated batching could reduce round trips.

There are no obvious major performance bottlenecks (like O(n^2) algorithms), but profiling the code on realistic workloads would likely reveal additional optimization targets.
</reasoning>
<score>6</score>

Error Handling and Security
<reasoning>
The code has some error handling in place, but it is fairly minimal and piecemeal. A few examples:

- The exponential backoff logic handles rate limiting errors from the API, but doesn't seem to handle other types of API errors, or network failures in the web requests. 

- There are a couple try/except blocks around parsing JSON, but many other places that could raise exceptions (like accessing dictionary keys) are not guarded.

- When an exception is caught, the program generally just prints a message and continues, rather than having a well-defined recovery path. In some cases this could leave the program in an inconsistent state.

- Timeouts are not used on the web requests, so a slow or hanging server could stall the program indefinitely.

In terms of security, there are some definite gaps:

- User input is directly interpolated into prompts without any escaping or sanitization. This could allow a malicious user to inject unwanted content into the prompts.

- The URLs provided by the user are directly opened without validating that they are well-formed and use a safe protocol. This could be a vector for SSRF attacks.

- The page content is rendered directly into messages without any filtering of potentially dangerous tags or scripts. This could allow XSS attacks if the chat logs are ever displayed to another user.

Proper input validation, contextual output escaping, and defined trust boundaries are needed to harden the program against malicious inputs.
</reasoning>
<score>4</score>  

Python-Specific Best Practices
<reasoning>
The code follows many good Python practices, such as:

- Using type hints to clarify function signatures
- Leveraging standard library modules like asyncio and json
- Utilizing popular and well-maintained third-party libraries like aiohttp and BeautifulSoup
- Preferring list comprehensions and generators over manual loops
- Defining an entry point for the program with `if __name__ == "__main__"`

There are a few areas that could be improved:

- Some of the list comprehensions and generator expressions are quite long and complex, hurting readability. Breaking them down or extracting helper functions could help.
- The `truncate` function uses a mutable default argument, which can lead to surprising behavior.
- The f-strings don't always use the more concise `{var}` form, sometimes using `{var}` unnecessarily.
- Some of the exception handling is too broad - it catches the base `Exception` class rather than more specific subclasses.
</reasoning>

<total_score>63</total_score>

<letter_grade>D</letter_grade>

In summary, while the code has some good elements, particularly in terms of leveraging Python language features and libraries, it has significant room for improvement in the areas of documentation, error handling, security, and efficiency. The lack of comments and input validation are especially concerning for a program that interacts with untrusted web content. Significant refactoring and hardening would be required to bring this up to production-quality code.
