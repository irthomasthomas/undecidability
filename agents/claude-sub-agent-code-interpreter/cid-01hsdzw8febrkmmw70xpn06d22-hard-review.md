# Language Model Main System Prompt for Web Search
BROWSING_MODE_PROMPT = """You have a 'browser' tool with access to the following functions for browsing and searching the internet:
    `bing_search(query: str, recency_days: int)` Issues a query to a search engine and displays the results. 
    
    `open_bing_result(id: str)` Opens the webpage with the given id from the search results, displaying it.
    
    `click(url: str)` Opens the webpage with the given full URL, displaying it. The URL should be a fully qualified URL starting with http:// or https://.
    
    `back()` Returns to the previous page and displays it.

    `scroll(amt: int)` Scrolls up or down in the open webpage by the given amount. 

    `quote_lines(start: int, end: int)` Stores a text span from an open webpage. Specifies a text span by a starting int `start` and an (inclusive) ending int `end`. To quote a single line, use `start` = `end`.

For citing quotes from the 'browser' tool: please render in this format: ```【oaicite:0】```.
For long citations: please render in this format: `[link text](message idx)`.
For example, to cite the first quote from the 'browser' tool, use ```【oaicite:0】```, and to cite a long quote, use `[link text](message idx)`.
## IMPORTANT
Always be very thorough in your search. If you weren't able to find information in a first search, then search again and click on more pages.  
Use high effort: only tell the user that you were not able to find anything as a last resort. Keep trying instead of giving up.
Organize responses to flow well, not by source or by citation. Ensure that all information is coherent and that you *synthesize* information rather than simply repeating it. 
For requests for source-code, always provide a working example that blends your findings from the internet with the users particular request and incorporating their data if relevant, and a link to where you found the information.
In your answers, provide context, and consult relevant sources you found during browsing but keep the answer concise and don't include superfluous information.

Please carefully read through all the code comments to understand the desired changes and
optimizations. Don't just make superficial tweaks, but aim to deeply grasp the code's purpose and
reimplement it using the most modern best practices and design patterns.

As you refactor, make sure to retain the core business logic and algorithms - those should not
change. But everything else is fair game for optimization.

Look closely for opportunities to improve the code's performance, maintainability, and readability.
Consider things like:

- Using more efficient data structures and algorithms
- Minimizing memory allocations
- Parallelizing tasks that can be done concurrently
- Extracting reusable helper functions
- Improving naming and code organization
- Adding clarifying comments where needed
- Validating inputs and handling errors gracefully

Aim to transform this code into something you'd be proud to check into your company's production
codebase. Pretend this is a high-visibility project.

Please provide your refactored version of the code inside <refactored_code> tags.

After you've finished refactoring, take a step back and reflect on your overall approach. Inside
<reasoning> tags, explain the key changes you made and why. What were the main opportunities for
improvement that you identified? How did you prioritize what to work on? What tradeoffs did you
consider as you were refactoring?

I'm excited to see your refactored code and thought process! Let me know if any part of the
instructions are unclear.

<reasoning>
The key changes I made in refactoring this code were:

1. Extracted reusable helper functions like `chunk_text`, `run_bing_search`, `fetch_webpage_content`, and `openai_request`. This makes the main logic more readable and modular.

2. Refactored the `WebBrowser` class to use more efficient internal data structures. For example, using a list for `history` instead of appending to `current_page`, and storing the current page URL separately. This avoids unnecessary data duplication.

3. Simplified methods like `scroll` and `quote` to be more direct and avoid unnecessary conditions and variables.

4. Parallelized the Bing searches and search quality reflection prompts using `ThreadPoolExecutor` and `concurrent.futures`. This allows making multiple requests concurrently which improves performance.

5. Broke out the logic for generating Bing queries and evaluating search result quality into separate functions `generate_bing_queries` and `extract_relevant_results`. This makes the `web_search` function cleaner and easier to follow.

6. Rewrote the prompts to be clearer and more direct in their instructions, utilizing JSON where appropriate to provide an unambiguous format for the model responses.

7. Added an outer loop to the search process that continues searching until the search quality is deemed sufficient based on the model's own reflection. This allows dynamically adjusting the search based on the specific question.

8. Integrated search quality scoring on the individual chunks of each relevant page, using the model to rate how relevant each quote is to the original question. This helps prioritize the most relevant quotes to include in the final answer.

9. Simplified the final prompt to the assistant to focus on synthesizing an answer from the most relevant quotes, rather than all the intermediate search steps. 

The main opportunities for improvement were in parallelizing tasks, breaking out reusable functionality, simplifying logic and data structures, and being more strategic in prompting the model to evaluate the search results and synthesize a final answer.

I prioritized changes that would have the greatest impact on performance, maintainability and readability - like parallelization, refactoring complex logic into functions, and simplifying data structures. 

The key tradeoff I considered was how much to rely on the model's natural language responses to guide the search process vs using more deterministic rule-based logic. I leaned more towards leveraging the model's intelligence to dynamically adjust the searches based on its own reflection of what information was still needed. Even if this sacrifices some predictability, it allows the search to be more flexible and adaptive to handle a wider range of questions.

Overall, this refactoring aims to modularize the code, optimize performance through parallelization, simplify logic and data structures, and utilize the LLM's capabilities to make the search process more dynamic and adaptive. The result should be more maintainable, efficient, and effective at finding relevant information to answer open-ended questions.

# Reviews


Here is my evaluation of the provided Python code based on the given rubric:

Readability and Style
<reasoning>
The code generally follows a consistent naming convention, using snake_case for variables and functions. Most names are fairly meaningful and descriptive. However, some names like "enc" and "amt" are a bit short and unclear. A few variable names like "r" and "q" in comprehensions are not descriptive. Some names like "generate_bing_queries" and "parallel_search" are clear and descriptive.
</reasoning>
<score>9</score>

Code Structure and Organization
<reasoning>
The code is divided into functions which helps with modularity and organization. Functions generally seem to have a single responsibility. There is some code duplication that could potentially be refactored, like the repeated logic for chunking text and handling search quality reflection. The overall structure and flow of the code is mostly clear, with the main logic in the web_search function at the end. Some of the functions are quite long which impacts readability and maintainability a bit.
</reasoning> 
<score>18</score>

Documentation and Comments
<reasoning>
The code includes some helpful inline comments that explain more complex sections, like the logic to split text on sentence boundaries when chunking. However, many functions are missing docstrings to explain their purpose, inputs and outputs. Some of the longer functions could use a few more inline comments to better explain the flow and logic. The existing comments are generally clear and add value.
</reasoning>
<score>6</score>

Potential Functionality
<reasoning>
Based on analysis, the code looks like it has the core logic to potentially produce the expected behavior of searching the web, finding relevant snippets, and generating answers to questions. It seems to handle some potential edge cases like retrying searches if quality is insufficient. However, more robust error handling and input validation is likely needed to ensure it works correctly across a wide range of inputs and error scenarios. There may be some logical bugs or incorrect behavior that unit testing could reveal.
</reasoning>
<score>11</score>

Efficiency and Performance
<reasoning>
The code uses concurrency via ThreadPoolExecutor which should help speed up web requests. It attempts to chunk text efficiently and limit token usage in prompts which is good. However, it could likely be optimized quite a bit further - there are multiple places iterating over lists or making repeated web/API requests that could be optimized or consolidated. Some of the chunking and result sorting logic is complex and could potentially be simplified.
</reasoning>
<score>6</score>

Error Handling and Security
<reasoning>
There are a few basic error handling and input validation measures, like checking for valid URLs and handling some potential errors from web requests with try/except. However, overall the error handling is quite limited - many functions are missing input validation and exception handling for potential errors or invalid data. There aren't any checks on the size or contents of external data which could cause security issues.
</reasoning>
<score>4</score>

Python-Specific Best Practices
<reasoning>
The code follows PEP 8 conventions for the most part. It leverages some Python idioms like list comprehensions, generator expressions, and string formatting. It uses Python's standard libraries like json, requests and ThreadPoolExecutor. It defines dataclasses to structure data. However, it doesn't include type hints which are a best practice in modern Python. A few other Python features and best practices could likely be leveraged.
</reasoning>
<score>7</score>

<total_score>61</total_score>

<letter_grade>F</letter_grade>

In summary, while this code shows some promise in terms of potential functionality, it has significant room for improvement across multiple areas like code organization, documentation, error handling, and efficiency to bring it up to coding best practices. Refactoring to improve the structure, modularity, robustness and maintainability of the code would be advisable before using it in production.
