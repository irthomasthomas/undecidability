# Language Model Main System Prompt for Web Search
BROWSING_MODE_PROMPT = """You have a 'browser' tool with access to the following functions for browsing and searching the internet:
    `bing_search(query: str, recency_days: int)` Issues a query to a search engine and displays the results. 
    
    `open_bing_result(id: str)` Opens the webpage with the given id from the search results, displaying it.
    
    `click(url: str)` Opens the webpage with the given full URL, displaying it. The URL should be a fully qualified URL starting with http:// or https://.
    
    `back()` Returns to the previous page and displays it.

    `scroll(amt: int)` Scrolls up or down in the open webpage by the given amount. 

    `quote_lines(start: int, end: int)` Stores a text span from an open webpage. Specifies a text span by a starting int `start` and an (inclusive) ending int `end`. To quote a single line, use `start` = `end`.

For citing quotes from the 'browser' tool: please render in this format: ```【oaicite:0】```.
For long citations: please render in this format: `[link text](message idx)`.
For example, to cite the first quote from the 'browser' tool, use ```【oaicite:0】```, and to cite a long quote, use `[link text](message idx)`.
## IMPORTANT
Always be very thorough in your search. If you weren't able to find information in a first search, then search again and click on more pages.  
Use high effort: only tell the user that you were not able to find anything as a last resort. Keep trying instead of giving up.
Organize responses to flow well, not by source or by citation. Ensure that all information is coherent and that you *synthesize* information rather than simply repeating it. 
For requests for source-code, always provide a working example that blends your findings from the internet with the users particular request and incorporating their data if relevant, and a link to where you found the information.
In your answers, provide context, and consult relevant sources you found during browsing but keep the answer concise and don't include superfluous information.

Please carefully read through all the code comments to understand the desired changes and
optimizations. Don't just make superficial tweaks, but aim to deeply grasp the code's purpose and
reimplement it using the most modern best practices and design patterns.

As you refactor, make sure to retain the core business logic and algorithms - those should not
change. But everything else is fair game for optimization.

Look closely for opportunities to improve the code's performance, maintainability, and readability.
Consider things like:

- Using more efficient data structures and algorithms
- Minimizing memory allocations
- Parallelizing tasks that can be done concurrently
- Extracting reusable helper functions
- Improving naming and code organization
- Adding clarifying comments where needed
- Validating inputs and handling errors gracefully

Aim to transform this code into something you'd be proud to check into your company's production
codebase. Pretend this is a high-visibility project.

Please provide your refactored version of the code inside <refactored_code> tags.

After you've finished refactoring, take a step back and reflect on your overall approach. Inside
<reasoning> tags, explain the key changes you made and why. What were the main opportunities for
improvement that you identified? How did you prioritize what to work on? What tradeoffs did you
consider as you were refactoring?

I'm excited to see your refactored code and thought process! Let me know if any part of the
instructions are unclear.

<reasoning>
The key changes I made in refactoring this code were:

1. Extracted reusable helper functions like `chunk_text`, `run_bing_search`, `fetch_webpage_content`, and `openai_request`. This makes the main logic more readable and modular.

2. Refactored the `WebBrowser` class to use more efficient internal data structures. For example, using a list for `history` instead of appending to `current_page`, and storing the current page URL separately. This avoids unnecessary data duplication.

3. Simplified methods like `scroll` and `quote` to be more direct and avoid unnecessary conditions and variables.

4. Parallelized the Bing searches and search quality reflection prompts using `ThreadPoolExecutor` and `concurrent.futures`. This allows making multiple requests concurrently which improves performance.

5. Broke out the logic for generating Bing queries and evaluating search result quality into separate functions `generate_bing_queries` and `extract_relevant_results`. This makes the `web_search` function cleaner and easier to follow.

6. Rewrote the prompts to be clearer and more direct in their instructions, utilizing JSON where appropriate to provide an unambiguous format for the model responses.

7. Added an outer loop to the search process that continues searching until the search quality is deemed sufficient based on the model's own reflection. This allows dynamically adjusting the search based on the specific question.

8. Integrated search quality scoring on the individual chunks of each relevant page, using the model to rate how relevant each quote is to the original question. This helps prioritize the most relevant quotes to include in the final answer.

9. Simplified the final prompt to the assistant to focus on synthesizing an answer from the most relevant quotes, rather than all the intermediate search steps. 

The main opportunities for improvement were in parallelizing tasks, breaking out reusable functionality, simplifying logic and data structures, and being more strategic in prompting the model to evaluate the search results and synthesize a final answer.

I prioritized changes that would have the greatest impact on performance, maintainability and readability - like parallelization, refactoring complex logic into functions, and simplifying data structures. 

The key tradeoff I considered was how much to rely on the model's natural language responses to guide the search process vs using more deterministic rule-based logic. I leaned more towards leveraging the model's intelligence to dynamically adjust the searches based on its own reflection of what information was still needed. Even if this sacrifices some predictability, it allows the search to be more flexible and adaptive to handle a wider range of questions.

Overall, this refactoring aims to modularize the code, optimize performance through parallelization, simplify logic and data structures, and utilize the LLM's capabilities to make the search process more dynamic and adaptive. The result should be more maintainable, efficient, and effective at finding relevant information to answer open-ended questions.

# Review 1: 81 - c


Here is my evaluation of the provided code against the rubric:

Readability and Style
<reasoning>
The code generally follows a consistent naming convention of using lowercase with underscores for variables and functions, and CamelCase for classes, which aligns with Python best practices. Most of the variable and function names are meaningful and descriptive, clearly conveying their purpose. A few, like "n" and "amt", could be more descriptive. Overall the code scores well on readability and style but has a few areas to improve.
</reasoning>
<score>20</score>

Code Structure and Organization
<reasoning>
The code is broken down into logical functions and classes, each focusing on a specific responsibility. The WebBrowser class encapsulates web browsing functionality. Helper functions handle tasks like text chunking, searching, and fetching web pages. This modular design promotes code reuse and follows the Single Responsibility Principle. The code is mostly organized in a clear, logical manner, although the parallel_search and related functions being defined in the global scope rather than a class is a bit inconsistent. With some minor reorganization, the code would score even higher in this area.
</reasoning>
<score>22</score>

Documentation and Comments
<reasoning>
The code includes some brief inline comments explaining what certain sections do, like "# Return chunks starting from current scroll position". However, many complex sections and functions lack comments entirely. The few comments are somewhat helpful but more thorough documentation throughout would significantly improve the code's maintainbility and make it easier for other developers to understand. Docstrings on the key functions describing their parameters and return values would be valuable additions.
</reasoning>
<score>6</score>

Potential Functionality
<reasoning>
Based on analyzing the code logic, the web search functionality seems comprehensive and well-structured to handle the core use case of finding relevant information to answer a question. Key aspects like query generation, parallel searching, search quality reflection, and extracting relevant page quotes are all implemented. The code appears to account for some potential edge cases, like chunking text on sentence boundaries and limiting the browsing history. However, more robust error handling around network requests and input validation would further improve this. Without actually running the code, it's hard to assess if it's bug-free, but no major logical errors stand out.
</reasoning>
<score>12</score>

Efficiency and Performance  
<reasoning>
The code leverages parallelization using ThreadPoolExecutor to run Bing searches and process results concurrently, which should boost efficiency. Text chunking avoids redundant operations by chunking only the necessary remainder text. The use of generators for chunking is also memory-efficient. Limiting the browsing history provides some bounds on memory usage. However, there may be room for further optimization in areas like the relevance scoring of all page chunks, which could get expensive for very large pages. The overall algorithmic approach seems reasonable but a few tweaks could likely eke out better performance. 
</reasoning>
<score>8</score>

Error Handling and Security
<reasoning>
Some basic error handling is implemented, like try/except blocks around network requests to handle and log exceptions. However, it's fairly minimal and many functions lack error handling entirely. User input isn't thoroughly validated before being used in web requests, which could pose injection risks if someone passed malicious input string. The code doesn't seem to handle the case of API requests returning an unsuccessful status code. More extensive error handling and input sanitization would be significant improvements. As-is, this is a weakness of the code.
</reasoning>  
<score>5</score>

Python-Specific Best Practices
<reasoning>
The code adheres to many Python conventions and best practices. It follows PEP 8 style guidelines reasonably well, with some minor deviations in naming and line length. It uses built-in Python functionality like generators and data classes to good effect. The ThreadPoolExecutor is an appropriate choice from the standard library for parallelization. However, it doesn't make use of type hints, which would help with readability and catching type-related errors. A few more Python-specific optimizations may be possible, but it ticks most of the key boxes here.
</reasoning>
<score>8</score>

<total_score>81</total_score>

<letter_grade>C</letter_grade>

In summary, the code is well-structured and functional with efficient use of parallelization and good style. However, the lack of thorough documentation, somewhat limited error handling, and room for further optimization hold it back from receiving top marks. With some focused improvements in those areas, it would be a very strong, maintainable piece of code. As it stands, based on the rubric, it receives a total score of 81, correlating to a letter grade of C.


# Review 2 80 - B




Here is my evaluation of the provided Python code based on the given rubric:

Readability and Style
<reasoning>
The code generally follows a consistent naming convention for variables, functions and classes, using underscores to separate words. Names are fairly descriptive and meaningful, though some like 'r' and 'q' could be more explicit. A few names like 'amt' are a bit terse. Overall the naming is solid but has some room for improvement.
</reasoning>
<score>20</score>

Code Structure and Organization
<reasoning>
The code is broken down into reasonable functions and classes like WebBrowser that encapsulate related functionality. Functions follow the Single Responsibility Principle for the most part. There is some duplication that could potentially be refactored, like the logic for appending '.' to the end of text chunks. The overall organization is fairly clear and logical. It could potentially be split into separate files but is organized reasonably within the single file.
</reasoning>
<score>21</score>

Documentation and Comments
<reasoning>
The code includes some inline comments that explain what certain sections are doing, but there could be more, especially for the more complex functions. The existing comments are clear and helpful but don't cover every non-obvious part. The usage and purpose of each function could be more clearly documented.
</reasoning>
<score>6</score>

Potential Functionality
<reasoning>
Based on reading through the code, it looks like it should be able to search the web, extract relevant pages, score text chunks within the pages, and generate answers to questions using the retrieved information, which seems to align with the intended behavior. There is some error handling and input validation but more edge cases could likely be covered. I don't see any glaring logical errors or bugs but more extensive testing would be needed to verify.
</reasoning>
<score>12</score>

Efficiency and Performance  
<reasoning>
The code uses threading via ThreadPoolExecutor to parallelize web searches which should help performance. It attempts to use appropriate data structures like deques for history. Algorithmically, it does a decent job of breaking text into relevant chunks. However, there are likely further optimizations that could be made, like caching search results to avoid re-fetching. The chunking logic could also potentially be made more performant.
</reasoning>
<score>7</score>

Error Handling and Security
<reasoning>
The code does include some error handling, like checking for and handling failing web requests with raise_for_status(). There is also some amount of user input validation. However, more comprehensive error handling could be added, especially around the OpenAI API calls. Hardening against potential security issues like SQL injection doesn't seem applicable here, but more validation could be added around the content retrieved from web searches.
</reasoning>
<score>6</score>

Python-Specific Best Practices
<reasoning>
The code does follow PEP 8 conventions for the most part. It leverages some Python idioms like list comprehensions and generator functions. It uses Python standard library modules like json, os and urllib effectively. The choice of data structures is generally appropriate. However, it does not guard against the mutable default argument issue. Overall it follows Python best practices well but a couple improvements could be made.
</reasoning>
<score>8</score>

<total_score>80</total_score>

<letter_grade>B</letter_grade>

In summary, this is a solid, well-organized piece of Python code that should be able to effectively retrieve web pages and generate answers to questions. The main areas for improvement are more comprehensive documentation, validation and error handling, and potentially more performance optimization. But overall this code meets the key criteria well and earns a B grade based on the provided rubric.
