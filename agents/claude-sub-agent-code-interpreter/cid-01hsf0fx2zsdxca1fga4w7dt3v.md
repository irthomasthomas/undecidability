# Language Model Main System Prompt for Web Search
BROWSING_MODE_PROMPT = """You have a 'browser' tool with access to the following functions for browsing and searching the internet:
    `bing_search(query: str, recency_days: int)` Issues a query to a search engine and displays the results. 
    
    `open_bing_result(id: str)` Opens the webpage with the given id from the search results, displaying it.
    
    `click(url: str)` Opens the webpage with the given full URL, displaying it. The URL should be a fully qualified URL starting with http:// or https://.
    
    `back()` Returns to the previous page and displays it.

    `scroll(amt: int)` Scrolls up or down in the open webpage by the given amount. 

    `quote_lines(start: int, end: int)` Stores a text span from an open webpage. Specifies a text span by a starting int `start` and an (inclusive) ending int `end`. To quote a single line, use `start` = `end`.

For citing quotes from the 'browser' tool: please render in this format: ```【oaicite:0】```.
For long citations: please render in this format: `[link text](message idx)`.
For example, to cite the first quote from the 'browser' tool, use ```【oaicite:0】```, and to cite a long quote, use `[link text](message idx)`.
## IMPORTANT
Always be very thorough in your search. If you weren't able to find information in a first search, then search again and click on more pages.  
Use high effort: only tell the user that you were not able to find anything as a last resort. Keep trying instead of giving up.
Organize responses to flow well, not by source or by citation. Ensure that all information is coherent and that you *synthesize* information rather than simply repeating it. 
For requests for source-code, always provide a working example that blends your findings from the internet with the users particular request and incorporating their data if relevant, and a link to where you found the information.
In your answers, provide context, and consult relevant sources you found during browsing but keep the answer concise and don't include superfluous information.

Please carefully read through the code and comments to fully understand the intended functionality
and business logic.

Your task is to completely rewrite this code to implement the same core functionality in the
cleanest, most efficient, most up-to-date way possible. Do not simply make small tweaks to the
existing code. Instead, redesign and reimplement it from scratch using modern best practices.

The rewritten code should retain the essential business logic and algorithms, but should not be
anchored to the original implementation. Feel free to use completely different libraries, data
structures, architectures, etc. if it results in cleaner, more efficient and maintainable code.

As you rewrite, look out for any code smells or antipatterns in the original that should be
eliminated. Identify any tasks or processes that could potentially be parallelized for better
performance. Make full use of language idioms and features that result in more robust and concise
code.

The end result should be production-quality code that you would be proud to submit to your company's
public repository. It should be clean, DRY, performant, well-structured and easy for other
developers to understand and maintain.

Please provide your fully refactored and optimized code inside <refactored_code> tags.

Key changes and improvements:

- Utilized async/await and aiohttp for asynchronous HTTP requests to improve performance
- Extracted configuration into separate settings object 
- Simplified WebBrowser class by making methods async and removing some state
- Improved retry logic using tenacity library
- Parallelized independent tasks like fetching webpage content
- Refactored model querying into reusable async query_chat_model function  
- Dynamically select model based on input token count to optimize cost/performance
- Built cleaner API for interacting with browser using descriptive tool schema
- Redesigned main web search loop to better track progress and recover from assistant issues
- Leveraged Python features like type hints, dataclasses, f-strings for cleaner code
- Organized code into clearer functions and methods with concise docstrings
- Eliminated repetitive logic, renamed variables and added comments for clarity

The refactored code retains the core search, browse and quote capabilities, but implements them in a much more robust, performant and maintainable way following modern Python best practices. It should be significantly faster and more reliable than the original.


# Evaluations

## Review 1 - Score 85 / B

Here is my evaluation of the provided Python code according to the given rubric:

Readability and Style
<reasoning>
The code generally follows a consistent naming convention, using snake_case for variables and functions. Most names are meaningful and descriptive, like "search", "scroll", "open", "back", etc. A few names could be improved, like "enc" and "amt". The code gets high marks here but has some room for improvement.
</reasoning>
<score>20</score>

Code Structure and Organization
<reasoning>
The code is nicely modularized into logical functions and classes. It follows the Single Responsibility Principle, with each function and class focused on a specific task. There is minimal duplication. The code is organized in a clear, logical way with web browser functionality in the WebBrowser class, web page fetching and processing functions, and browser action handling separated out. The structure and organization are quite strong.
</reasoning>
<score>23</score>

Documentation and Comments
<reasoning>
The code includes some comments explaining what certain code blocks do at a high-level. However, it lacks inline comments explaining more complex or non-obvious sections. The existing comments are a bit sparse. More detailed comments, especially for the more involved functions, would improve the code's documented clarity.
</reasoning>
<score>6</score>

Potential Functionality 
<reasoning>
From analyzing the code, it appears to have the necessary components to achieve its web browsing and searching functionality. The logic looks sound for the most part, like handling potential edge cases of invalid URLs and failed web requests by retrying. There don't appear to be any glaring logical errors or bugs. However, without running the code, I can't be completely certain it will produce the expected output in all cases.
</reasoning>
<score>12</score>

Efficiency and Performance
<reasoning>
The code uses asynchronous I/O with aiohttp for efficient fetching of web pages concurrently. It minimizes unnecessary computations by checking things like token limits before calling the language model. It avoids redundant operations through functions like is_absolute_url. However, it could potentially improve performance further by moving some string parsing logic to compiled regex. Overall though, the code follows performance best practices.
</reasoning>
<score>8</score>

Error Handling and Security
<reasoning>
The code includes good error handling and exception handling for its web requests, retrying failed requests multiple times with exponential backoff. It validates some user inputs like relative vs absolute URLs. It uses type hints to validate argument types. However, it could do more comprehensive input validation, especially around arguments coming from JSON. There aren't any obvious security vulnerabilities but more could be done to harden it.
</reasoning>
<score>7</score>

Python-Specific Best Practices
<reasoning>
The code follows the PEP 8 style guide quite well. It uses some Python idioms like type hints and asyncio. It leverages the Python standard library with modules like json, urllib, and typing. It uses appropriate Python data types like dicts and lists. It doesn't seem to run afoul of Python gotchas like mutable default arguments. The code is a good demonstration of Python best practices, deserving a solid score.
</reasoning>
<score>9</score>

<total_score>85</total_score>

<letter_grade>B</letter_grade>

In summary, this is a well-written, well-organized piece of Python code that achieves its functionality with efficiency and follows Python best practices. To elevate it from a B to an A, the main things to focus on would be adding more detailed comments and documentation, hardening the security and error handling further, and verifying it produces the expected outputs when run. But overall this is a very good Python codebase deserving of a solid B grade.



## Review 2 - Score 73 / C
Here is my evaluation of the provided Python code based on the given rubric:

Readability and Style
<reasoning>
The code generally follows a consistent naming convention, using snake_case for variables and functions. Some variable and function names are descriptive (e.g. search_results, scroll, open, fetch_webpage_content). However, there are a few abbreviations used (e.g. amt, enc) and some very generic names (e.g. data, content, stripped, formatted) that could be more descriptive. The code gets reasonably good marks for following a naming convention, but has room for improvement on choosing consistently clear, meaningful names.
</reasoning>
<score>18</score>

Code Structure and Organization
<reasoning>
The code is reasonably well structured and modular. Functionality is divided across multiple classes and functions. The SearchResult and WebBrowser classes encapsulate related data and behaviors. The standalone utility functions also help break up the code. There are still some lengthy functions that could potentially be broken down further (e.g. manage_browser_task). The code isn't heavily duplicative. However, the code organization and separation of concerns could be improved - having the web fetching, search result management, and LLM prompting mixed together in the manage_browser_task function is not ideal organization. The level of modularity is reasonable but could be better.
</reasoning> 
<score>19</score>

Documentation and Comments
<reasoning>
The code includes a docstring for the main web_search function, which is good. However, none of the other functions or classes have docstrings explaining what they do. There are very few inline comments explaining any of the code. The code would benefit from more thorough documentation, both at the function/class level and within the function bodies. 
</reasoning>
<score>5</score>

Potential Functionality
<reasoning>
Based on an initial review, the code looks like it should be able to successfully perform web searches by querying the Bing API, extracting page content, chunking the text, prompting the LLM, and executing requested "browser" actions in a loop until a search quality reflection is detected. The logic seems reasonable to achieve the intended functionality. However, without actually running the code, it's hard to be 100% sure it is free of bugs or will gracefully handle all edge cases. Some more validation of the Bing search results and LLM responses may be prudent. But in general the core logic looks sound.
</reasoning>
<score>12</score>

Efficiency and Performance  
<reasoning>
The code uses async/await with aiohttp for making web requests, which is a performant approach. Retries are implemented for graceful handling of failed requests. The text chunking logic is reasonably efficient. However, the fact that new tokens are encoded for each LLM prompt/response could use some optimization. The looping logic to allow the LLM to take multiple actions until reaching a stopping point could also potentially get stuck in very long loops. So there are some good practices used but still some areas that could likely be optimized further.
</reasoning>
<score>7</score>

Error Handling and Security
<reasoning>
The code uses retry logic to gracefully handle potential errors when making web requests. It validates that web responses have a 200 status code. It also has some error handling around validating if URLs are absolute before navigating. However, there are many areas where errors could occur that do not have any error handling - for example, if an invalid action or missing arguments are returned by the LLM. There is no validation or sanitization of the search queries. More comprehensive error and exception handling would improve the robustness and security of the code.
</reasoning>
<score>6</score>

Python-Specific Best Practices
<reasoning>
The code does leverage some Python idioms and best practices, such as using typing hints, f-strings, async/await, and context managers for opening/closing connections. However, it does not follow some key aspects of PEP8, like the 79 character line limit. It could leverage some other Python features like dataclasses. The code also does not seem to handle Python-specific issues like circular imports or mutable default arguments. Following PEP8 and other Python conventions more closely would improve this code from a Pythonic best practice perspective.  
</reasoning>
<score>6</score>

<total_score>73</total_score>

<letter_grade>C</letter_grade>

In summary, this Python code follows some good practices and has the basic logic in place to likely achieve its intended web searching functionality. However, to improve its quality, it would benefit from more descriptive naming, better organization/modularization, much more thorough documentation, more comprehensive error handling, and stricter adherence to PEP8 and other Python-specific best practices and idioms. With some refactoring and cleanup, this code could be improved to a higher quality level. But in its current state, based on the defined rubric, I would assess it as a C-level piece of code.
Here is my evaluation of the provided Python code based on the given rubric:

Readability and Style
<reasoning>
The code generally follows a consistent naming convention, using snake_case for variables and functions. Most names are descriptive and meaningful, clearly conveying the purpose of the function or variable. However, some names are a bit terse or unclear, like "enc", "amt", and "scroll". A few more comments explaining non-obvious names would improve readability.

<score>20</score>

Code Structure and Organization
<reasoning>
The code is broken down into logical functions and classes, showing good modularity. Functions generally follow the Single Responsibility Principle, having a clear single purpose. There is some code duplication that could potentially be refactored, like the retry decorator and error handling in the API request functions. The overall organization is fairly clear, but the main execution code at the bottom should be wrapped in a `if __name__ == "__main__":` block.
</reasoning>
<score>20</score>

Documentation and Comments
<reasoning>
The code includes some helpful docstrings on the key functions explaining what they do. A few more inline comments in the complex `manage_browser_task` function would help explain the control flow. Some of the single-letter variable names could use clarifying comments.  
</reasoning>
<score>7</score>

Potential Functionality
<reasoning>
The code looks like it implements all the key pieces needed to conduct an automated web search and analyze the results, including search, quoting, scrolling, etc. The main query answering logic seems sound, with appropriate handling for the assistant getting stuck. Some more validation of API responses and error handling would improve robustness.
</reasoning>
<score>12</score>

Efficiency and Performance  
<reasoning>
The code makes good use of asynchronous I/O for making web requests concurrently, which will help efficiency. The exponential backoff retry logic is a best practice for external API calls. Creating chunks of a certain token size is smart for staying within model context limits. The recursive `manage_browser_task` logic may run for a very long time on complex queries though. Setting an upper bound on recursion depth would be safer.
</reasoning>
<score>8</score>

Error Handling and Security
<reasoning>
Key API calls are wrapped with try/except and retry logic to gracefully handle errors. The code validates that API responses are successful before parsing them. However, there is no validation that the user-provided "query" is safe and not malicious. API keys are accessed directly from the config file, when they should be loaded from environment variables or a secrets manager to reduce security risk. User input is directly interpolated into URLs, which opens risk of injection issues.
</reasoning>  
<score>6</score>

Python-Specific Best Practices
<reasoning>
The code has a good balance of leveraging Python libraries like aiohttp while using standard paradigms like classes and async/await. Type hints are consistently used, which is great for clarity and catching type errors. A few more PyLint or MyPy directives to validate type correctness would be helpful. Axiomatic constants like `settings.chunk_size` should be all-caps. The `if __name__ == "__main__":` guard is missing for the execution code at the bottom.
</reasoning>

<letter_grade>C</letter_grade>

In summary, this is a well-structured Python script that effectively automates web searches and result parsing. The core logic is sound and it uses asynchronous best practices. However, there are some gaps in validation, security best practices, and type safety that bring the overall grade down to a C. With some focused improvements in those areas, this could easily be an A-level piece of code.



# Review 3 - Hard reviewer

Here is my evaluation of the provided Python code based on the given rubric:

Readability and Style
<reasoning>
The code generally follows a consistent naming convention of using snake_case for variables and functions, and PascalCase for classes, which aids readability. Most variable and function names are descriptive and meaningful. A few, like 'enc' and 'amt', could be more descriptive. The code also has a few instances of extra whitespace and long lines over 80-100 characters that slightly impact readability.
</reasoning>
<score>20</score>

Code Structure and Organization
<reasoning>
The code is broken up into logical functions and classes following the Single Responsibility Principle. The WebBrowser class encapsulates browser-related functionality well. There is good modularity and minimal code duplication. A few functions like manage_browser_task() are quite long and could potentially be broken up further. The overall organization and flow is fairly clear and easy to follow.
</reasoning>
<score>21</score>

Documentation and Comments
<reasoning>
The code includes some helpful comments explaining what certain sections are doing. However, the commenting is fairly minimal overall. More comments, especially for complex sections and explaining the purpose of each function/class would improve the documentation. Docstrings are also missing for documenting functions and classes.
</reasoning>
<score>5</score>

Potential Functionality 
<reasoning>
Based on analyzing the code structure and logic, it appears the code has the key components to potentially search the web, navigate pages, scroll content, select quotes, and manage the browser automation flow to try to answer a given query. Proper exception handling for HTTP requests helps deal with potential issues. However, without running the code, it's difficult to fully assess if it will work as intended for all cases and edge scenarios. More extensive testing would be needed to fully evaluate functionality.
</reasoning>
<score>12</score>

Efficiency and Performance
<reasoning>
The code uses async/await and aiohttp for async HTTP requests which helps efficiency. The @retry decorators also help make error-prone operations more robust. Creating chunks of content and using different LLMs based on token size demonstrates performance considerations. However, there may be room to further optimize some of the looping logic and data processing for better efficiency.
</reasoning>
<score>8</score>

Error Handling and Security
<reasoning>
The code validates and handles potential errors in a few key places, such as:
- Checking for absolute URLs before navigating
- Catching and retrying failed HTTP requests with @retry 
- Raising exceptions for failed requests with resp.raise_for_status()
However, more comprehensive error handling throughout would be ideal, especially for catching and handling any exceptions that could be raised. User input doesn't appear to be a big concern here, but more input validation is usually good practice.
</reasoning>
<score>7</score>

Python-Specific Best Practices
<reasoning>
The code follows many Python conventions and best practices, such as:
- Using type hints for function parameters and return values
- Using asyncio for concurrency 
- Using list comprehensions like [SearchResult(result) for result in search_results]
- Using built-in functions like max(), min() effectively
- Handling Python-specific issues like absolute vs relative imports
A few areas for improvement:
- Following the PEP8 79-char line limit and 2 lines between top-level functions more consistently
- Using if __name__ == "__main__" convention for main program flow
</reasoning>
<score>8</score>

<total_score>81</total_score>

<letter_grade>C</letter_grade>

In summary, the code is structured reasonably well with good use of classes, functions and async practices. Functionality looks promising but is hard to fully evaluate without testing. Key areas to improve are more comprehensive documentation/commenting, more consistent style following PEP8, and more extensive error handling. With some polishing and refinement, this code could be quite good. But based on the rubric criteria as given, it scores 81/104 which equates to a letter grade of C.
