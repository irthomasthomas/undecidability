    Prompt:
    $prompt

    <code>
    $CODE
    </code>

    Add comments throughout the code with your notes, questions and suggestions for improvement. Prepend
    each comment with a tag like Question, ToFix, ToOptimize, etc. to make the purpose of each comment
    easy to see at a glance.

    Analyze the time complexity of the various algorithms in the code using big O notation. For any
    algorithms with high time complexity, propose alternative implementations that would be more
    efficient.

    Look for opportunities to simplify and deduplicate the code without altering the core business
    logic. Don't limit yourself to just tweaking the existing code. Feel free to completely re-architect
    and re-implement the functionality using modern best practices and the most efficient data
    structures and algorithms for the task. However, make sure to retain the essential business logic
    and core algorithms.

    As you refactor, keep an eye out for code smells and opportunities to parallelize tasks for better
    performance.

    Please implement your proposed optimized version of the code, aiming for a production-quality,
    clean, DRY and performant implementation that you would be proud to check into your company's public
    repo. Avoid writing simplistic example code - treat this as real-world production code.

    Provide your re-implementation inside <optimized_code> tags.
