Here are my notes and a refactored version of the code:

Comments and Questions:
```python
# Question: Is there a reason this is being run directly in the global scope instead of inside a main() function or class?
openai_client, bing_search_key, custom_search_key = initialize_clients()
print(f"Test web search") 
browser = WebBrowser()

# ToOptimize: web_search performs a lot of sequential operations. Many of these could potentially be parallelized 
# to improve performance, especially the I/O bound operations like API calls and web requests.
answer_text = web_search("example question needing a web search to answer.",  
                         openai_client, custom_search_key, BROWSING_MODE_PROMPT, browser)

# ToFix: This prints out markdown but it's not clear what the purpose is. Does this need to be part of the core logic?
print(highlight(answer_text, MarkdownLexer(), TerminalFormatter()))

# Question: The query_model function falls back to a different model if the token count is high, 
# but it's not clear why. Some comments explaining the reasoning would help.
def query_model(user_query, openai_client, tools, system_message, messages=None):
    ...
    if token_estimate > 15000:
        model = "openai/gpt-4-turbo-preview" 
    else:
        model = "openai/gpt-3.5-turbo-0125"
    ...

# ToOptimize: The web_search function is quite long and complex. Breaking it up into smaller, focused functions
# would improve readability and maintainability. The multiple levels of nested if/else blocks are a code smell.
def web_search(user_question, openai_client, bing_search_key, system_message, browser):
    ...

# ToOptimize: generate_bing_queries_for_user_question uses a loop and retry logic that is repeated in other 
# places like json_gpt. This could be extracted into a reusable decorator or utility function.
def generate_bing_queries_for_user_question(user_question: str, model: str) -> List[str]:
    ...
    retries = 3
    while retries > 0:
        try:
            ...    
        except Exception as e:
            print(f"Error occurred while generating search queries: {e}")
            retries -= 1
    ...

# ToFix: It's not clear what the purpose of this formatting is or why it needs to be a separate function.
# Inlining it or adding comments would help.
def format_webpage(webpage):
    """
    Formats the given webpage content by adding line numbers.
    """
    formatted = ""
    lines = webpage.split("\n")
    line_num = 1 
    for line in lines:
        formatted += f"{line_num}. {line}\n"
        line_num += 1
    return formatted
```

Time Complexity Analysis:
- `create_chunks`: This is O(n) where n is the length of the input text. It does a single pass through the tokens.
- `fetch_webpage_content`: This makes an API call which is O(1), but in the worst case may make the call multiple times, so worst case is O(max_retries).
- `process_search_results`: This filters the search results based on a condition which is O(n) where n is the number of search results.
- The other key functions are I/O bound (making API requests) so their time complexity is based on the response time of the external services.

</optimized_code>

Key changes:
- Pulled initialize code into a main function 
- Extracted OpenAI interactions into a reusable `openai_completion` function with built-in retry logic
- Parallelized fetching and extracting from search result pages using ThreadPoolExecutor
- Added search quality reflection and re-querying logic to improve relevance 
- Refactored WebBrowser and SearchResult into more focused classes
- Used a requests.Session with automatic retries for more resilient HTTP requests
- Removed some unnecessary abstractions like format_webpage

Let me know if you have any other questions! The refactored code should be more modular, efficient, and resilient while still retaining the core search -> extract -> summarize flow of the original.
