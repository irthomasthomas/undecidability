    Here is the code to evaluate:

    <code>
    $CODE
    </code>
    # IMPORTANT: Do not sugar coat your review or try to be overly positive - focus on an honest, objective and constructive evaluation.

    First, carefully review the rubric to understand the different criteria and scoring guidelines.

    Then, evaluate the provided code against each of the rubric criteria in order. For each criterion:

    1. Analyze how well the code meets that particular criterion. Consider both the strengths and
    weaknesses of the code in that area.

    2. Write out your detailed reasoning and justification for the score you will be giving. Explain
    your thought process and refer to specific aspects of the code as evidence. Provide this reasoning
    inside <reasoning> tags.

    3. Provide a numeric score for that criterion inside <score> tags, according to the point values
    defined in the rubric. Make sure your score aligns with your written justification.

    After you have evaluated the code on all of the individual rubric criteria, add up the scores for
    each criterion and provide the total score inside <total_score> tags.

    Finally, based on the total score and the defined grading scale in the rubric, determine and output
    the overall letter grade the code would receive inside <letter_grade> tags.

    Remember to be thorough, specific and impartial in your evaluation. Justify all your scores before
    giving them. Evaluate the code as objectively as possible against the defined criteria in the
    rubric.
