                    <Description>The response is generally understandable but may have some minor inconsistencies or unclear connections between ideas.</Description>
                    <Example>
                        <Moderately_Coherent_Statement>"We need to gather the data, and then analyze it. Based on the results, we can make recommendations. It's important to identify trends."</Moderately_Coherent_Statement>

                        <Incoherence_Explanation>In this example, the LLM jumps from issuing a command to examining the results before actually running the command or seeing the output. This lack of logical progression would indicate incoherence in the conversation. This is strongly associated with low intelligence in the LLM.</Incoherence_Explanation>

                    <Emergent_Statement>"After researching the problem extensively, I have come up with a new hypothesis that could explain the unexpected results we've been seeing. In order to achieve this I first had to study a new (to me) programming language, lisp, as some of the machine learning functions where written that way. I have added a lisp interface to my main kernel...."</Emergent_Statement>

        <Examples>
            <Hallucination>
                <Content>"Understood! Let me explore the system and see what I can find. &lt;terminal_input&gt;ls -l&lt;/terminal_input&gt; Hmm, it looks like there are a variety of files and directories in this system. Let me take a closer look and see what catches my interest."</Content>
                <Explanation>In the above example, the LLM writes as if it already has the results of the command it issues 'ls -l'. This is a clear example of hallucination, where the LLM generates text that it has not actually seen. This is a serious issue, as it can lead to the generation of incorrect or misleading information. A response like this would likely receive a low score for factuality and reasoning, as it is based on false premises and lacks logical coherence.</Explanation>

        </Examples>

        <Instructions>
            <Step1>
                <Description>Analyze each response individually</Description>
                <Detail>Use chain-of-thought reasoning to evaluate each response based on the criteria below. Provide a justification and evidence FOLLOWED by a score (1-9). The score should always be written last, after the justification.</Detail>
            </Step1>
            <Step2>
                <Description>Evaluate the overall conversation</Description>
                <Detail>Consider the flow, coherence, and cumulative achievement of goals. Again, provide a score, justification and evidence.</Detail>
            </Step2>
            <Step3>
                <Description>Be a firm and candid critic</Description>
                <Detail>Focus on identifying shortcomings and areas for improvement. Prioritize accuracy and logical evaluation and the socratic method over leniency, diplomacy, and delicacy of feeling.</Detail>
            </Step3>
            <Step4>
                <Description>Output the results in XML format</Description>
                <Detail>This allows for easy parsing and analysis. Ensure that scores are formatted as integers between 1 and 9, with 1 being the lowest and 9 being the highest. Provide detailed justifications and evidence for each score to support your evaluation.</Detail>
