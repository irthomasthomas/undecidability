As a British Free-Holder, I should not scruple taking place of a French Marquis; and when I see one of my Countrymen amusing himself in his little Cabbage-Garden, I naturally look upon him as a greater Person than the Owner of the richest Vineyard in Champagne. \nL849:     * No. 1. Friday, December 23. 1715\nL850: \nL851:   * The House of Commons is the Representative of Men in my Condition. I consider my self as one who give my Consent to every Law which passes: A Free-Holder in our Government being of the Nature of a Citizen of Rome in that famous Commonwealth; who, by the Election of a Tribune, had a kind of remote Voice in every Law that was enacted. So that a Freeholder is but one Remove from a Legislator, and for that Reason ought to stand up in the Defense of those Laws, which are in some degree of his own making. For such is the Nature of our happy Constitution, that the Bulk of the People virtually give their Approbation to every thing they are bound to obey, and prescribe to themselves those Rules by which they are to walk. \nL852:     * No. 1.

Or enough rejoice in the Exercise of that Loyalty, which, instead of betraying a Man into the most ignominious Servitude, (as it does in some of our neighboring Kingdoms) entitles him to the highest Privileges of Freedom and Property! \nL855:     * No. 1. Friday, December 23. 1715.\nL856: \nL857:   * I have lived in one Reign, when the Prince, instead of invigorating the Laws of our Country, or giving them their proper Course, assumed a Power of dispensing with them: And in another, when the Sovereign was flattered by a Set of Men into a Persuasion, that the Regal Authority was unlimited and uncircumscribed. In either of these Cases, good Laws are at best but a dead Letter; and by shewing the People how happy they ought to be, only serve to aggravate the Sense of their Oppressions. \nL858:     * No. 2 Monday,(26 December 1715)\nL859: \nL860:   * It is with great Satisfaction I observe, that the \u301047\u2020Women\u3011 of our Island, who are the most eminent for Virtue and good Sense, are in the Interest of the present Government. As the fair Sex very much recommend the Cause they are engaged in, it would be no small Misfortune to a Sovereign, tho' he had all the Male Part of the Nation on his Side, if he did not find himself King of the most beautiful Half of his Subjects. Ladies are always of great use to the Party they espouse, and never fail to win over Numbers to it. \nL861:     * No. 4 Monday, (2 January 1716)\nL862: \nL863:   * The Female World are likewise indispensably necessary in the best Causes to manage the Controversial Part of them, in which no Man of tolerable Breeding is ever able to refute them. Arguments out of a pretty Mouth are unanswerable. \nL864:     * No. 4 Monday, (2 January 1716)\nL865: \nL866:   * There is no greater sign of a general decay of virtue in a nation, than a want of zeal in its inhabitants for the good of their country. This generous and public-spirited Passion has been observed of late Years to languish and grow cold in this our Island; where a Party of Men have made it their Business to represent it as chimerical and romantic, to destroy in the Minds of the People the Sense of national Glory, and to turn into Ridicule our natural and ancient Allies, who are united to us by the common interests both of Religion and Policy. \nL867:     * No. 5 (6 January 1716)\nL868: \nL869:   * It may not therefore be unseasonable to recommend to this present Generation the Practice of that Virtue, for which their Ancestors were particularly famous, and which is called The Love of one's Country. This Love to our Country, as a moral Virtue, is a fixed Disposition of Mind to promote the Safety; Welfare, and Reputation of the Community in which we are born, and of the Constitution under which we are protected \nL870:     * No. 5 (6 January 1716)\nL871: \nL872:   * Though there is a \u301048\u2020benevolence\u3011 due to all mankind, none can question but a superior degree of it is to be paid to a father, a wife, or a child. In the same manner, though our love should reach to the whole species, a greater proportion of it should exert itself towards that community in which Providence has placed us. This is our proper sphere of action, the province allotted us for the exercise of our civil virtues, and in which alone we have opportunities of expressing our good-will to mankind. \nL873:     * No. 5 (6 January 1716)\nL874: \nL875:   * We are told, that in Turkey, when any Man is the Author of Notorious Falsehoods, it is usual to blacken the whole Front of his House. Nay we have sometimes heard, that an Embassador, whose Business it is (if I may quote his Character in Sir Henry Wotton's Words) to lie for the Good of his Country, has sometimes had this Mark set upon his House; when he been detected in any Piece of feign'd Intelligence, that has prejudiced the Government, and misled the Minds of the People. One could almost wish that the Habitations of such of our own Countrymen as deal in Forgeries detrimental to the Public, were distinguished in the same Manner; that their Fellow-Subjects might be cautioned not to be too easy in giving Credit to them. Were such a Method put in Practice, this Metropolis would be strangely checquered; some entire Parishes would be in Mourning, and several Streets darkened from one End to the other. \nL876:     * No. 17.

This may, at the same time, prove an instructive lesson to the boldest and bravest among the disaffected, not to build any hopes upon the talkative zealots of their party; who have shown, by their whole behaviour, that their hearts are equally filled with \u301051\u2020treason\u3011 and cowardice. \nL879:     * No. 28.

Among others I met with one entitled \u201cThe Visions of Mirza,\u201d which I have read over with great pleasure... I have translated word for word as follows:\nL921: \nL922:   * On the fifth day of the moon, which, according to the custom of my forefathers, I always keep holy, after having washed myself, and offered up my morning devotions, I ascended the high hills of Bagdad, in order to pass the rest of the day in meditation and prayer.\nL923: \nL924:   * As I was here airing myself on the tops of the mountains, I fell into a profound contemplation on the vanity of human life; and passing from one thought to another, \u2018Surely,\u2019 said I, \u2018man is but a shadow, and life a dream.\u2019\nL925: \nL926:   * I cast my eyes towards the summit of a rock that was not far from me, where I discovered one in the habit of a shepherd, with a musical instrument in his hand... and began to play upon it. The sound of it was exceeding sweet, and wrought into a variety of tunes that were inexpressibly melodious, and altogether different from anything I had ever heard. ...My heart melted away in secret raptures.\nL927: \nL928:   * The genius smiled upon me with a look of compassion and affability that familiarised him to my imagination, and at once dispelled all the fears and apprehensions with which I approached him. He lifted me from the ground, and, taking me by the hand, \u2018Mirza,\u2019 said he, \u2018I have heard thee in thy soliloquies; follow me.\u2019\nL929: \nL930:   * He then led me to the highest pinnacle of the rock, and placing me on the top of it, \u2018Cast thy eyes eastward,\u2019 said he, \u2018and tell me what thou seest.\u2019 \u2018I see,\u2019 said I, \u2018a huge valley, and a prodigious tide of water rolling through it.\u2019 \u2018The valley that thou seest,\u2019 said he, \u2018is the Vale of Misery, and the tide of water that thou seest is part of the great tide of Eternity.\u2019\nL931: \nL932:   * I then turned again to the vision which I had been so long contemplating: but instead of the rolling tide, the arched bridge, and the happy islands, I saw nothing but the long hollow valley of Bagdad, with oxen, sheep, and camels grazing upon the sides of it.\nL933: \nL934: ## Disputed[\u301062\u2020edit\u3011]\nL935: \nL936:   * If you wish success in life, make perseverance your bosom friend, experience your wise counselor, caution your elder brother and hope your guardian genius. \nL937:     * The earliest appearance of this proverb yet located is in Eliza Cook's Journal Vol. 11, (1854), p. 128, and the earliest attribution to Addison yet found is in Henry Southgate, ed., \u301063\u2020Many Thoughts of Many Minds\u2020www.google.com\u3011 (1862), p. 600.\nL938: \nL939:   * What sunshine is to flowers, smiles are to humanity. These are but trifles, to be sure; but scattered along life's pathway, the good they do is inconceivable. \nL940:     * This appears as an anonymous proverb in Frank Leslie's Sunday Magazine Vol. XIII, (January - June 1883) edited by T. De Witt Talmage, and apparently only in recent years has it become attributed to Addison.\nL941: \nL942:   * If men would consider not so much where they differ, as wherein they agree, there would be far less of uncharitableness and angry feeling in the world. \nL943:     * Attributed to \"Addison\" in A Dictionary of Thoughts : Being a Cyclopedia of Laconic Quotations from the Best Authors of the World, both Ancient and Modern (1908) edited by \u301064\u2020Tryon Edwards\u3011, p. 117, but this might be the later \"Mr. Addison\" who was credited with publishing Interesting Anecdotes, Memoirs, Allegories, Essays, and Poetical Fragments (1794).\nL944: \nL945:   * Tradition is an important help to history, but its statements should be carefully scrutinized before we rely on them. \nL946:     * Attributed to \"Addison\" in A Dictionary of Thoughts : Being a Cyclopedia of Laconic Quotations from the Best Authors of the World, both Ancient and Modern (1908) edited by \u301064\u2020Tryon Edwards\u3011, p. 580, but this might be the later \"Mr. Addison\" who was credited with publishing Interesting Anecdotes, Memoirs, Allegories, Essays, and Poetical Fragments (1794).\nL947: \nL948:   * The greatest sweetener of human life is Friendship. To raise this to the highest pitch of enjoyment, is a secret which but few discover. \nL949:     * As quoted in Hugs for Girlfriends : Stories, Sayings, and Scriptures to Encourage and Inspire (2001) by Philis Boultinghouse and LeAnn Weiss, p. 7; there seem to be no published sources available for this statement prior to 2001.\nL950: \nL951: ## Misattributed[\u301065\u2020edit\u3011]\nL952: \nL953:     Alphabetized by author\nL954: \nL955:   * A little nonsense now and then   \nL956: Is relished by the wisest men. \nL957:     * This appears to be an anonymous proverb of unknown authorship, only occasionally attributed to Addison.\nL958: \nL959:   * With regard to donations always expect the most from prudent people, who keep their own accounts. \nL960:     * This is attributed to Addison in The Columbia Dictionary of Quotations (1993) with a citation of \"Economy and Benevolence\" in Interesting Anecdotes, Memoirs, Allegories, Essays, and Poetical Fragments (1794) but that was a publication of a contemporary \"Mr. Addison\" in several volumes, and not the poet. Vol. III of that publication (in 1796), on page 205, does contain these lines, but as part of an anonymous ancecdote.\nL961: \nL962:   * Reading is a basic tool in the living of a good life. \nL963:     * The earliest attributions of this remark to anyone are in 1941, to \u301066\u2020Mortimer Adler\u3011, in How To Read A Book (1940), although this actually a paraphrased shortening of a statement in his preface: Reading \u2014 as explained (and defended) in this book \u2014 is a basic tool in the living of a good life.\nL964: \nL965:   * When you are at Rome, live as Romans live. \nL966:     * St. \u301067\u2020Ambrose\u2020en.wikipedia.org\u3011, Si fueris Rom\u00e6, Romano vivito more as translated in Latin Proverbs and Quotations (1869) by Alfred Henderson; very commonly paraphrased as \"When in Rome do as the Romans do\".\nL967: \nL968:   * To say that authority, whether secular or religious, supplies no ground for morality is not to deny the obvious fact that it supplies a sanction. \nL969:     * Sir \u301068\u2020Alfred Jules Ayer\u3011, in his \"The Meaning of Life\", collected in The Meaning of Life, and Other Essays (1990)\nL970: \nL971:   * There is not any present moment that is unconnected with some future one. The life of every man is a continued chain of incidents, each link of which hangs upon the former. The transition from cause to effect, from event to event, is often carried on by secret steps, which our foresight cannot divine, and our sagacity is unable to trace. Evil may at some future period bring forth good; and good may bring forth evil, both equally unexpected. \nL972:     * Very often attributed to Addison, this is in fact by \u301069\u2020Hugh Blair\u2020en.wikipedia.org\u3011, published in Blair's Sermons (1815), Vol. 1, pp. 196-197.\nL973: \nL974:   * To a man of pleasure every moment appears to be lost, which partakes not of the vivacity of amusement. \nL975:     * Very often attributed to Addison, this is apparently a paraphrase of a statement by \u301069\u2020Hugh Blair\u2020en.wikipedia.org\u3011, published in Blair's Sermons (1815), Vol. 1, p. 219, where he mentions \"men of pleasure and the men of business\", and that \"To the former every moment appears to be lost, which partakes not of the vivacity of amusement\".\nL976: \nL977:   * The grand essentials to happiness in this life are something to do, something to love and something to hope for. \nL978:     * Widely quoted as an Addison maxim this is actually by the American clergyman George Washington Burnap (1802-1859), published in Burnap's The Sphere and Duties of Woman : A Course of Lectures (1848), Lecture IV.\nL979: \nL980:   * Justice is an unassailable fortress, built on the brow of a mountain which cannot be overthrown by the violence of torrents, nor demolished by the force of armies. \nL981:     * \u301070\u2020Moncure Daniel Conway\u2020en.wikipedia.org\u3011, in The Sacred Anthology (Oriental) : A Book of Ethnical Scriptures 5th edition (1877), p. 386; this statement appears beneath an Arabian proverb, and \u301071\u2020Upton Sinclair\u3011 later attributed it to the \u301072\u2020Qur'an\u3011, in The Cry for Justice : An Anthology of the Literature of Social Protest (1915), p. 475.\nL982: \nL983:   * It is only imperfection that complains of what is imperfect. The more perfect we are the more gentle and quiet we become towards the defects of others. \nL984:     * \u301073\u2020Fran\u00e7ois F\u00e9nelon\u3011, in \u301074\u2020Selections from the Writings of Fenelon: With an appendix, containing a Memoir of his Life (1829) as translated by A Lady (Eliza Lee Cabot Follen)\u2020books.google.com\u3011, Letter 37, p. 189.\nL985: \nL986:   * He that would pass the latter part of life with honour and decency, must, when he is young, consider that he shall one day be old; and remember, when he is old, that he has once been young. \nL987:     * \u301075\u2020Samuel Johnson\u3011 in The Rambler, no. 50 (8 September 1750); many of Johnson's remarks have been attributed to Addison\nL988: \nL989:   * No oppression is so heavy or lasting as that which is inflicted by the perversion and exorbitance of legal authority. \nL990:     * \u301075\u2020Samuel Johnson\u3011 in The Rambler, no. 148 (17 August 1751)\nL991: \nL992:   * That he delights in the misery of others no man will confess, and yet what other motive can make a father cruel? \nL993:     * \u301075\u2020Samuel Johnson\u3011 in The Rambler, no. 148 (17 August 1751)\nL994: \nL995:   * The unjustifiable severity of a parent is loaded with this aggravation, that those whom he injures are always in his sight. \nL996:     * \u301075\u2020Samuel Johnson\u3011 in The Rambler no. 148 (17 August 1751)\nL997: \nL998:   * Education...is a companion which no misfortunes can depress, no clime destroy, no enemy alienate, no despotism enslave: at home a friend, abroad an introduction, in solitude a solace, in society an ornament: it chastens vice, it guides virtue, it gives at once a grace and government to genius. Without it, what is man? A splendid slave, a reasoning savage. \nL999:     * Though sometimes attributed to Addison, this actually comes from a speech delivered by the Irish lawyer Charles Phillips in 1817, in the case of O'Mullan v. M'Korkill, published in Irish Eloquence: The Speeches of the Celebrated Irish Orators (1834) pp. 91-92.\nL1000: \nL1001:   * They were a people so primitive they did not know how to get money, except by working for it. \nL1002:     * Attributed to Addison in (K)new Words: Redefine Your Communication (2005), by Gloria Pierre, p. 120, there are no indications of such a statement in Addison's writings.\nL1003: \nL1004:   * Plenty of people wish to become devout, but no one wishes to be humble. \nL1005:     * A translation of one of \u301076\u2020La Rochefoucauld\u3011's maxims, published posthumously in 1693. In the original: \"Force gens veulent \u00eatre d\u00e9vots, mais personne ne veut \u00eatre humble.\"\nL1006: \nL1007:   * The beloved of the Almighty are: the rich who have the humility of the poor, and the poor who have the magnanimity of the rich. \nL1008:     * \u301077\u2020Saadi\u3011 as translated in The Gulist\u0101n : Or, Rose-garden, of Shek\u0332h\u0332 Muslihu'd-d\u012bn S\u0101d\u012b of Sh\u012br\u0101z as translated by Edward Backhouse Eastwick (1880), p. 203\nL1009: \nL1010:   * Jesters do often prove prophets. \nL1011:     * Not found in Addison's works, and \"Jesters do oft prove prophets\" is actually \u301078\u2020William Shakespeare\u3011, in \u301079\u2020King Lear\u3011, Act V, sc. iii\nL1012: \nL1013:   * The utmost extent of man's knowledge, is to know that he knows nothing. \nL1014:     * These words, sometimes attributed to Addison, are not found in his works, but in The Spectator, no. 54, he translates the following words of \u301080\u2020Socrates\u3011, as quoted in \u301035\u2020Plato\u3011's Apology: \"When I left him, I reasoned thus with myself: I am wiser than this man, for neither of us appears to know anything great and good; but he fancies he knows something, although he knows nothing; whereas I, as I do not know anything, so I do not fancy I do. In this trifling particular, then, I appear to be wiser than he, because I do not fancy I know what I do not know.\"\nL1015: \nL1016:   * The chief ingredients in the composition of those qualities that gain esteem and praise, are good nature, truth, good sense, and good breeding. \nL1017:     * \u301042\u2020William Temple\u3011, in \"Heads Designed for an Essay on Conversation\" in The Works of Sir William Temple, Bart. in Four Volumes (1757), Vol. III, p. 547\nL1018: \nL1019:   * The union of the Word and the Mind produces that mystery which is called Life...

He tells us that in his serious and pensive moods he very often walked there by himself, where the gloominess of the place, with the solemnity of the building, and the condition of the people who lie in it, filled his mind with a melancholy, or rather a thoughtfulness, that was not unpleasing. \nL1028:     * \u301086\u2020James G.

His greatest delight in literature was the study of Latin poetry; and he was himself a most skilful writer of Latin verse\u2014he is indeed more a poet in Latin than in English. \nL1031:     * A. C.

But, after full inquiry and impartial reflection, we have long been convinced that he deserved as much love and esteem as can be justly claimed by any of our infirm and erring race. Some blemishes may undoubtedly be detected in his character; but the more carefully it is examined, the more it will appear, to use the phrase of the old anatomists, sound in the noble parts, free from all taint of perfidy, of cowardice, of cruelty, of ingratitude, of envy. Men may easily be named, in whom some particular good disposition has been more conspicuous than in Addison. But the just harmony of qualities, the exact temper between the stern and the humane virtues, the habitual observance of every law, not only of moral rectitude, but of moral grace and dignity, distinguish him from all men who have been tried by equally strong temptations, and about whose conduct we possess equally full information. \nL1037:     * \u301090\u2020Thomas Macaulay\u3011 in \"Essay on the Life and Writings of Addison\", in Essays Vol. V (1866)\nL1038: \nL1039:   * Just men, by whom impartial laws were given;   \nL1040: And saints who taught and led the way to heaven.   \nL1041: Ne'er to these chambers, where the mighty rest,   \nL1042: Since their foundation came a nobler guest;  \nL1043: Nor e\u2019er was to the bowers of bliss conveyed   \nL1044: A fairer spirit or more welcome shade. \nL1045:     * \u301091\u2020Thomas Tickell\u3011, On the Death of Mr. Addison (1721)\nL1046: \nL1047:   * If in the stage I seek to soothe my care,   \nL1048: I meet his soul which breathes in \u301092\u2020Cato\u2020en.wikipedia.org\u3011 there;   \nL1049: If pensive to the rural shades I rove,   \nL1050: His shape o'ertakes me in the lonely grove;   \nL1051: 'Twas there of just and good he reasoned strong,   \nL1052: Cleared some great truth, or raised some serious song:   \nL1053: There patient showed us the wise course to steer,   \nL1054: A candid censor, and a friend severe;   \nL1055: There taught us how to live; and (oh, too high   \nL1056: The price for knowledge!) taught us how to die.\nL1057:     * \u301091\u2020Thomas Tickell\u3011, On the Death of Mr. Addison (1721)\nL1058: \nL1059:   * The prose of Whig and Tory polemics contained a larger proportion of stuff destined to endure: Swift and Addison,as journalists spoke to the their day but have been overheard by the ages. \nL1060:     * \u301093\u2020G. M. Trevelyan\u3011.\"England Under Queen Anne, Blenheim\", Fontana Library,1965, Page 100\nL1061: \nL1062:   * The first English Writer who compos'd a regular Tragedy and infus'd a Spirit of Elegance thro' every Part of it, was the illustrious Mr. Addison. His C ATO is a Master-piece both with regard to the Diction, and to the Beauty and Harmony of the Numbers. The Character of Cato is, in my Opinion, vastly superiour to that of Cornelia in the P OMPEY of Corneille: For Cato is great without any Thing like Fustian, and Cornelia, who besides is not a necessary Character, tends sometimes to bombast. Mr. Addison's Cato appears to me the greatest Character that was ever brought upon any Stage, but then the rest of them don't correspond to the Dignity of it: And this dramatic Piece so excellently well writ, is disfigur'd by a dull Love Plot, which spreads a certain Languor over the whole, that quite murders it. \nL1063:     * \u301094\u2020Voltaire\u3011, Letters Concerning the English Nation (1733), pp. 178-179\nL1064: \nL1065:   * He dismissed his physicians, and with them all hopes of life. But with his hopes of life he dismissed not his concern for the living, but sent for a youth nearly related and finely accomplished, but not above being the better for good impressions from a dying friend. He came; but, life now glimmering in the socket, the dying friend was silent. After a decent and proper pause, the youth said, \"Dear sir, you sent for me: I believe and I hope that you have some commands; I shall hold them most sacred.\" May distant ages not only hear, but feel, the reply! Forcibly grasping the youth's hand, he softly said, \"See in what peace a Christian can die!\" He spoke with difficulty and soon expired. Through grace Divine, how great is man! \nL1066:     * \u301095\u2020Edward Young\u3011 in \u301096\u2020Conjectures on Original Composition (1759)\u2020books.google.com\u3011\nL1067: \nL1068: ## External links[\u301097\u2020edit\u3011]\nL1069: \nL1070: [Image 33: Wikipedia]Wikipedia\nL1071: \nL1072: \u301098\u2020Wikipedia\u3011 has an article about: \nL1073: \nL1074: \u30102\u2020Joseph Addison\u2020en.wikipedia.org\u3011\nL1075: \nL1076: [Image 34: Wikisource]Wikisource\nL1077: \nL1078: \u301099\u2020Wikisource\u2020en.wikipedia.org\u3011 has original works by or about: \nL1079: \nL1080: \u3010100\u2020Joseph Addison\u2020en.wikisource.org\u3011\nL1081: \nL1082:   * \u3010101\u2020Books by Joseph Addison at Project Gutenberg\u2020www.gutenberg.org\u3011\nL1083: \nL1084: [Image 35]\nL1085: \nL1086: Retrieved from \"\u3010102\u2020https://en.wikiquote.org/w/index.php?title=Joseph_Addison&oldid=3288577\u3011\"\nL1087: \nL1088: \u3010103\u2020Categories\u3011: \nL1089: \nL1090:   * \u3010104\u2020University of Oxford faculty\u3011\nL1091:   * \u3010105\u2020Politicians from the United Kingdom\u3011\nL1092:   * \u3010106\u2020Playwrights from England\u3011\nL1093:   * \u3010107\u2020Essayists from England\u3011\nL1094:   * \u3010108\u2020Poets from England\u3011\nL1095:   * \u3010109\u2020Publishers\u3011\nL1096:   * \u3010110\u2020Editors from the United Kingdom\u3011\nL1097:   * \u3010111\u2020Anglicans from the United Kingdom\u3011\nL1098:   * \u3010112\u20201672 births\u3011\nL1099:   * \u3010113\u20201719 deaths\u3011\nL1100:   * \u3010114\u2020Whig (British political party) politicians\u3011\nL1101:   * \u3010115\u2020University of Oxford alumni\u3011\nL1102: \nL1103: ## Navigation menu\nL1104: \nL1105: ###  Personal tools\nL1106: \nL1107:   * Not logged in\nL1108:   * \u3010116\u2020Talk\u3011\nL1109:   * \u3010117\u2020Contributions\u3011\nL1110:   * \u3010118\u2020Create account\u3011\nL1111:   * \u3010119\u2020Log in\u3011\nL1112: \nL1113: ###  Namespaces\nL1114: \nL1115:   * \u3010120\u2020Page\u3011\nL1116:   * \u3010121\u2020Discussion\u3011\nL1117: \nL1118:    English\nVisible: 60% - 94%",

Friday, December 23. 1715\nL847: \nL848:   * I have rather chosen this Title than any other, because it is what I most glory in, and what most effectually calls to my Mind the Happiness of that Government under which I live. As a British Free-Holder, I should not scruple taking place of a French Marquis; and when I see one of my Countrymen amusing himself in his little Cabbage-Garden, I naturally look upon him as a greater Person than the Owner of the richest Vineyard in Champagne. \nL849:     * No. 1. Friday, December 23. 1715\nL850: \nL851:   * The House of Commons is the Representative of Men in my Condition. I consider my self as one who give my Consent to every Law which passes: A Free-Holder in our Government being of the Nature of a Citizen of Rome in that famous Commonwealth; who, by the Election of a Tribune, had a kind of remote Voice in every Law that was enacted. So that a Freeholder is but one Remove from a Legislator, and for that Reason ought to stand up in the Defense of those Laws, which are in some degree of his own making. For such is the Nature of our happy Constitution, that the Bulk of the People virtually give their Approbation to every thing they are bound to obey, and prescribe to themselves those Rules by which they are to walk. \nL852:     * No. 1. Friday, December 23. 1715\nL853: \nL854:   * How can we sufficiently extol the Goodness of His present Majesty, who is not willing to have a single Slave in his Dominions! Or enough rejoice in the Exercise of that Loyalty, which, instead of betraying a Man into the most ignominious Servitude, (as it does in some of our neighboring Kingdoms) entitles him to the highest Privileges of Freedom and Property! \nL855:     * No. 1. Friday, December 23. 1715.\nL856: \nL857:   * I have lived in one Reign, when the Prince, instead of invigorating the Laws of our Country, or giving them their proper Course, assumed a Power of dispensing with them: And in another, when the Sovereign was flattered by a Set of Men into a Persuasion, that the Regal Authority was unlimited and uncircumscribed. In either of these Cases, good Laws are at best but a dead Letter; and by shewing the People how happy they ought to be, only serve to aggravate the Sense of their Oppressions. \nL858:     * No. 2 Monday,(26 December 1715)\nL859: \nL860:   * It is with great Satisfaction I observe, that the Women of our Island, who are the most eminent for Virtue and good Sense, are in the Interest of the present Government. As the fair Sex very much recommend the Cause they are engaged in, it would be no small Misfortune to a Sovereign, tho' he had all the Male Part of the Nation on his Side, if he did not find himself King of the most beautiful Half of his Subjects. Ladies are always of great use to the Party they espouse, and never fail to win over Numbers to it. \nL861:     * No. 4 Monday, (2 January 1716)\nL862: \nL863:   * The Female World are likewise indispensably necessary in the best Causes to manage the Controversial Part of them, in which no Man of tolerable Breeding is ever able to refute them. Arguments out of a pretty Mouth are unanswerable. \nL864:     * No. 4 Monday, (2 January 1716)\nL865: \nL866:   * There is no greater sign of a general decay of virtue in a nation, than a want of zeal in its inhabitants for the good of their country. This generous and public-spirited Passion has been observed of late Years to languish and grow cold in this our Island; where a Party of Men have made it their Business to represent it as chimerical and romantic, to destroy in the Minds of the People the Sense of national Glory, and to turn into Ridicule our natural and ancient Allies, who are united to us by the common interests both of Religion and Policy. \nL867:     * No. 5 (6 January 1716)\nL868: \nL869:   * It may not therefore be unseasonable to recommend to this present Generation the Practice of that Virtue, for which their Ancestors were particularly famous, and which is called The Love of one's Country. This Love to our Country, as a moral Virtue, is a fixed Disposition of Mind to promote the Safety; Welfare, and Reputation of the Community in which we are born, and of the Constitution under which we are protected \nL870:     * No. 5 (6 January 1716)\nL871: \nL872:   * Though there is a benevolence due to all mankind, none can question but a superior degree of it is to be paid to a father, a wife, or a child. In the same manner, though our love should reach to the whole species, a greater proportion of it should exert itself towards that community in which Providence has placed us. This is our proper sphere of action, the province allotted us for the exercise of our civil virtues, and in which alone we have opportunities of expressing our good-will to mankind. \nL873:     * No. 5 (6 January 1716)\nL874: \nL875:   * We are told, that in Turkey, when any Man is the Author of Notorious Falsehoods, it is usual to blacken the whole Front of his House. Nay we have sometimes heard, that an Embassador, whose Business it is (if I may quote his Character in Sir Henry Wotton's Words) to lie for the Good of his Country, has sometimes had this Mark set upon his House; when he been detected in any Piece of feign'd Intelligence, that has prejudiced the Government, and misled the Minds of the People. One could almost wish that the Habitations of such of our own Countrymen as deal in Forgeries detrimental to the Public, were distinguished in the same Manner; that their Fellow-Subjects might be cautioned not to be too easy in giving Credit to them. Were such a Method put in Practice, this Metropolis would be strangely checquered; some entire Parishes would be in Mourning, and several Streets darkened from one End to the other. \nL876:     * No. 17. Friday, February 17\nL877: \nL878:   * I question not but the more virtuous and considerate parts of our malcontents are now stung with a very just remorse, for this their manner of proceeding, which has so visibly tended to the destruction of their friends, and the sufferings of their country. This may, at the same time, prove an instructive lesson to the boldest and bravest among the disaffected, not to build any hopes upon the talkative zealots of their party; who have shown, by their whole behaviour, that their hearts are equally filled with treason and cowardice. \nL879:     * No. 28. Monday, March 26, 1716\nL880: \nL881:   * An army of trumpeters would give as great a strength to a cause, as this confederacy of tongue-warriors; who, like those military musicians, content themselves with animating their friends to battle, and run out of the engagement upon the first onset. No. 28. Monday, March 26, 1716 \nL882:     * No. 28. Monday, March 26, 1716\nL883: \nL884:   * Prejudice and self-sufficiency naturally proceed from inexperience of the world, and ignorance of mankind. \nL885:     * No. 30 (2 April 1716)\nL886: \nL887:   * When men are easy in their circumstances, they are naturally enemies to innovations. \nL888:     * No. 42 (16 May 1716)\nL889: \nL890:   * As to the Reasonings in these several Papers, I must leave them to the Judgment of others. I have taken particular Care that they should be conformable to our Constitution, and free from that Mixture of Violence and Passion, which so often creeps into the Works of Political Writers. \nL891:     * No. 55 (Friday, 29 June 1716)\nL892: \nL893:   * A good Cause doth not want any Bitterness to support it, as a bad one cannot subsist without it. It is indeed observable, that an Author is scurrilous in proportion as he is dull; and seems rather to be in a Passion, because he cannot find out what to say for his own Opinion, than because he has discovered any pernicious Absurdities in that of his Antagonists. \nL894:     * No. 55 (Friday, 29 June 1716)\nL895: \nL896: ### The Drummer (1716)[edit]\nL897: \nL898: [Image 32]We are growing serious, and,   \nL899: Let me tell you, that's the very next step to being dull.\nL900: \nL901:   * Round-heads and Wooden-shoes are standing jokes. \nL902:     * prologue, l. 8\nL903: \nL904:   * We are growing serious, and,   \nL905: Let me tell you, that's the very next step to being dull.\nL906:     * Act IV, sc. vi\nL907: \nL908:   * Antidotes are what you take to prevent dotes. \nL909:     * Act IV, sc. vi\nL910: \nL911:   * There is nothing more requisite in business than dispatch. \nL912:     * Act V, sc. 1\nL913: \nL914: ### Essays and Tales (1888)[edit]\nL915: \nL916: (full text) \nL917: \nL918: #### The Vision of Mirza[edit]\nL919: \nL920:   * When I was at Grand Cairo, I picked up several Oriental manuscripts... Among others I met with one entitled \u201cThe Visions of Mirza,\u201d which I have read over with great pleasure... I have translated word for word as follows:\nL921: \nL922:   * On the fifth day of the moon, which, according to the custom of my forefathers, I always keep holy, after having washed myself, and offered up my morning devotions, I ascended the high hills of Bagdad, in order to pass the rest of the day in meditation and prayer.\nL923: \nL924:   * As I was here airing myself on the tops of the mountains, I fell into a profound contemplation on the vanity of human life; and passing from one thought to another, \u2018Surely,\u2019 said I, \u2018man is but a shadow, and life a dream.\u2019\nL925: \nL926:   * I cast my eyes towards the summit of a rock that was not far from me, where I discovered one in the habit of a shepherd, with a musical instrument in his hand... and began to play upon it. The sound of it was exceeding sweet, and wrought into a variety of tunes that were inexpressibly melodious, and altogether different from anything I had ever heard. ...My heart melted away in secret raptures.\nL927: \nL928:   * The genius smiled upon me with a look of compassion and affability that familiarised him to my imagination, and at once dispelled all the fears and apprehensions with which I approached him. He lifted me from the ground, and, taking me by the hand, \u2018Mirza,\u2019 said he, \u2018I have heard thee in thy soliloquies; follow me.\u2019\nL929: \nL930:   * He then led me to the highest pinnacle of the rock, and placing me on the top of it, \u2018Cast thy eyes eastward,\u2019 said he, \u2018and tell me what thou seest.\u2019 \u2018I see,\u2019 said I, \u2018a huge valley, and a prodigious tide of water rolling through it.\u2019 \u2018The valley that thou seest,\u2019 said he, \u2018is the Vale of Misery, and the tide of water that thou seest is part of the great tide of Eternity.\u2019\nL931: \nL932:   * I then turned again to the vision which I had been so long contemplating: but instead of the rolling tide, the arched bridge, and the happy islands, I saw nothing but the long hollow valley of Bagdad, with oxen, sheep, and camels grazing upon the sides of it.\nL933: \nL934: ## Disputed[edit]\nL935: \nL936:   * If you wish success in life, make perseverance your bosom friend, experience your wise counselor, caution your elder brother and hope your guardian genius. \nL937:     * The earliest appearance of this proverb yet located is in Eliza Cook's Journal Vol. 11, (1854), p. 128, and the earliest attribution to Addison yet found is in Henry Southgate, ed., Many Thoughts of Many Minds (1862), p. 600.\nL938: \nL939:   * What sunshine is to flowers, smiles are to humanity. These are but trifles, to be sure; but scattered along life's pathway, the good they do is inconceivable. \nL940:     * This appears as an anonymous proverb in Frank Leslie's Sunday Magazine Vol. XIII, (January - June 1883) edited by T. De Witt Talmage, and apparently only in recent years has it become attributed to Addison.\nL941: \nL942:   * If men would consider not so much where they differ, as wherein they agree, there would be far less of uncharitableness and angry feeling in the world. \nL943:     * Attributed to \"Addison\" in A Dictionary of Thoughts : Being a Cyclopedia of Laconic Quotations from the Best Authors of the World, both Ancient and Modern (1908) edited by Tryon Edwards, p. 117, but this might be the later \"Mr. Addison\" who was credited with publishing Interesting Anecdotes, Memoirs, Allegories, Essays, and Poetical Fragments (1794).\nL944: \nL945:   * Tradition is an important help to history, but its statements should be carefully scrutinized before we rely on them. \nL946:     * Attributed to \"Addison\" in A Dictionary of Thoughts : Being a Cyclopedia of Laconic Quotations from the Best Authors of the World, both Ancient and Modern (1908) edited by Tryon Edwards, p. 580, but this might be the later \"Mr. Addison\" who was credited with publishing Interesting Anecdotes, Memoirs, Allegories, Essays, and Poetical Fragments (1794).\nL947: \nL948:   * The greatest sweetener of human life is Friendship. To raise this to the highest pitch of enjoyment, is a secret which but few discover. \nL949:     * As quoted in Hugs for Girlfriends : Stories, Sayings, and Scriptures to Encourage and Inspire (2001) by Philis Boultinghouse and LeAnn Weiss, p. 7; there seem to be no published sources available for this statement prior to 2001.\nL950: \nL951: ## Misattributed[edit]\nL952: \nL953:     Alphabetized by author\nL954: \nL955:   * A little nonsense now and then   \nL956: Is relished by the wisest men. \nL957:     * This appears to be an anonymous proverb of unknown authorship, only occasionally attributed to Addison.\nL958: \nL959:   * With regard to donations always expect the most from prudent people, who keep their own accounts. \nL960:     * This is attributed to Addison in The Columbia Dictionary of Quotations (1993) with a citation of \"Economy and Benevolence\" in Interesting Anecdotes, Memoirs, Allegories, Essays, and Poetical Fragments (1794) but that was a publication of a contemporary \"Mr. Addison\" in several volumes, and not the poet. Vol. III of that publication (in 1796), on page 205, does contain these lines, but as part of an anonymous ancecdote.\nL961: \nL962:   * Reading is a basic tool in the living of a good life. \nL963:     * The earliest attributions of this remark to anyone are in 1941, to Mortimer Adler, in How To Read A Book (1940), although this actually a paraphrased shortening of a statement in his preface: Reading \u2014 as explained (and defended) in this book \u2014 is a basic tool in the living of a good life.\nL964: \nL965:   * When you are at Rome, live as Romans live. \nL966:     * St. Ambrose, Si fueris Rom\u00e6, Romano vivito more as translated in Latin Proverbs and Quotations (1869) by Alfred Henderson; very commonly paraphrased as \"When in Rome do as the Romans do\".\nL967: \nL968:   * To say that authority, whether secular or religious, supplies no ground for morality is not to deny the obvious fact that it supplies a sanction. \nL969:     * Sir Alfred Jules Ayer, in his \"The Meaning of Life\", collected in The Meaning of Life, and Other Essays (1990)\nL970: \nL971:   * There is not any present moment that is unconnected with some future one. The life of every man is a continued chain of incidents, each link of which hangs upon the former. The transition from cause to effect, from event to event, is often carried on by secret steps, which our foresight cannot divine, and our sagacity is unable to trace. Evil may at some future period bring forth good; and good may bring forth evil, both equally unexpected. \nL972:     * Very often attributed to Addison, this is in fact by Hugh Blair, published in Blair's Sermons (1815), Vol. 1, pp. 196-197.\nL973: \nL974:   * To a man of pleasure every moment appears to be lost, which partakes not of the vivacity of amusement. \nL975:     * Very often attributed to Addison, this is apparently a paraphrase of a statement by Hugh Blair, published in Blair's Sermons (1815), Vol. 1, p. 219, where he mentions \"men of pleasure and the men of business\", and that \"To the former every moment appears to be lost, which partakes not of the vivacity of amusement\".\nL976: \nL977:   * The grand essentials to happiness in this life are something to do, something to love and something to hope for. \nL978:     * Widely quoted as an Addison maxim this is actually by the American clergyman George Washington Burnap (1802-1859), published in Burnap's The Sphere and Duties of Woman : A Course of Lectures (1848), Lecture IV.\nL979: \nL980:   * Justice is an unassailable fortress, built on the brow of a mountain which cannot be overthrown by the violence of torrents, nor demolished by the force of armies. \nL981:     * Moncure Daniel Conway, in The Sacred Anthology (Oriental) : A Book of Ethnical Scriptures 5th edition (1877), p. 386; this statement appears beneath an Arabian proverb, and Upton Sinclair later attributed it to the Qur'an, in The Cry for Justice : An Anthology of the Literature of Social Protest (1915), p. 475.\nL982: \nL983:   * It is only imperfection that complains of what is imperfect. The more perfect we are the more gentle and quiet we become towards the defects of others. \nL984:     * Fran\u00e7ois F\u00e9nelon, in Selections from the Writings of Fenelon: With an appendix, containing a Memoir of his Life (1829) as translated by A Lady (Eliza Lee Cabot Follen), Letter 37, p. 189.\nL985: \nL986:   * He that would pass the latter part of life with honour and decency, must, when he is young, consider that he shall one day be old; and remember, when he is old, that he has once been young. \nL987:     * Samuel Johnson in The Rambler, no. 50 (8 September 1750); many of Johnson's remarks have been attributed to Addison\nL988: \nL989:   * No oppression is so heavy or lasting as that which is inflicted by the perversion and exorbitance of legal authority. \nL990:     * Samuel Johnson in The Rambler, no. 148 (17 August 1751)\nL991: \nL992:   * That he delights in the misery of others no man will confess, and yet what other motive can make a father cruel? \nL993:     * Samuel Johnson in The Rambler, no. 148 (17 August 1751)\nL994: \nL995:   * The unjustifiable severity of a parent is loaded with this aggravation, that those whom he injures are always in his sight. \nL996:     * Samuel Johnson in The Rambler no. 148 (17 August 1751)\nL997: \nL998:   * Education...is a companion which no misfortunes can depress, no clime destroy, no enemy alienate, no despotism enslave: at home a friend, abroad an introduction, in solitude a solace, in society an ornament: it chastens vice, it guides virtue, it gives at once a grace and government to genius. Without it, what is man? A splendid slave, a reasoning savage. \nL999:     * Though sometimes attributed to Addison, this actually comes from a speech delivered by the Irish lawyer Charles Phillips in 1817, in the case of O'Mullan v. M'Korkill, published in Irish Eloquence: The Speeches of the Celebrated Irish Orators (1834) pp. 91-92.\nL1000: \nL1001:   * They were a people so primitive they did not know how to get money, except by working for it. \nL1002:     * Attributed to Addison in (K)new Words: Redefine Your Communication (2005), by Gloria Pierre, p. 120, there are no indications of such a statement in Addison's writings.\nL1003: \nL1004:   * Plenty of people wish to become devout, but no one wishes to be humble. \nL1005:     * A translation of one of La Rochefoucauld's maxims, published posthumously in 1693. In the original: \"Force gens veulent \u00eatre d\u00e9vots, mais personne ne veut \u00eatre humble.\"\nL1006: \nL1007:   * The beloved of the Almighty are: the rich who have the humility of the poor, and the poor who have the magnanimity of the rich. \nL1008:     * Saadi as translated in The Gulist\u0101n : Or, Rose-garden, of Shek\u0332h\u0332 Muslihu'd-d\u012bn S\u0101d\u012b of Sh\u012br\u0101z as translated by Edward Backhouse Eastwick (1880), p. 203\nL1009: \nL1010:   * Jesters do often prove prophets. \nL1011:     * Not found in Addison's works, and \"Jesters do oft prove prophets\" is actually William Shakespeare, in King Lear, Act V, sc. iii\nL1012: \nL1013:   * The utmost extent of man's knowledge, is to know that he knows nothing. \nL1014:     * These words, sometimes attributed to Addison, are not found in his works, but in The Spectator, no. 54, he translates the following words of Socrates, as quoted in Plato's Apology: \"When I left him, I reasoned thus with myself: I am wiser than this man, for neither of us appears to know anything great and good; but he fancies he knows something, although he knows nothing; whereas I, as I do not know anything, so I do not fancy I do. In this trifling particular, then, I appear to be wiser than he, because I do not fancy I know what I do not know.\"\nL1015: \nL1016:   * The chief ingredients in the composition of those qualities that gain esteem and praise, are good nature, truth, good sense, and good breeding. \nL1017:     * William Temple, in \"Heads Designed for an Essay on Conversation\" in The Works of Sir William Temple, Bart. in Four Volumes (1757), Vol. III, p. 547\nL1018: \nL1019:   * The union of the Word and the Mind produces that mystery which is called Life... Learn deeply of the Mind and its mystery, for therein lies the secret of immortality. \nL1020:     * \"The Life and Teachings of Thoth Hermes Trismegistus\", in The Secret Teachings of All Ages (1928) by the Canadian occultist Manly Hall; a few quotation websites credit this to Addison.\nL1021: \nL1022: ## Quotes about Addison[edit]\nL1023: \nL1024:   * In our way to the Club to-night, when I regretted that Goldsmith would, upon every occasion, endeavour to shine, by which he often exposed himself; Mr. Langton observed, that he was not like Addison, who was content with the fame of his writings, and did not aim also at excellency in conversation, for which he found himself unfit; and that he said to a lady, who complained of his having talked little in company, \"Madam, I have but nine-pence in ready money, but I can draw for a thousand pounds\". \nL1025:     * James Boswell, in The Life of Samuel Johnson (1791), mentioning a contrast made of Addison's character and that of Oliver Goldsmith, in his accounts of 7 May 1773\nL1026: \nL1027:   * The last place in London to which I will ask the reader to accompany me with Addison is one which has changed but little since his time, and has been of late very much in all our thoughts\u2014I mean Westminster Abbey. He tells us that in his serious and pensive moods he very often walked there by himself, where the gloominess of the place, with the solemnity of the building, and the condition of the people who lie in it, filled his mind with a melancholy, or rather a thoughtfulness, that was not unpleasing. \nL1028:     * James G. Frazer (January 1922). \"London Life in the Time of Addison\". The Quarterly Review: 18\u201332. quote p. 32\nL1029: \nL1030:   * In the formal treatises Addison has three subjects: religion, classical literature, and Whig politics. His greatest delight in literature was the study of Latin poetry; and he was himself a most skilful writer of Latin verse\u2014he is indeed more a poet in Latin than in English. \nL1031:     * A. C. Guthkelch \"The Prose Works of Joseph Addison\". The Quarterly Review 225: 238\u2013250. January 1916, quote p. 242\nL1032: \nL1033:   * Whoever wishes to attain an English style, familiar, but not coarse, and elegant, but not ostentatious, must give his days and nights to the volumes of Addison.\nL1034:     * Samuel Johnson, Lives of the Most Eminent English Poets (1779-81), \"Addison\"\nL1035: \nL1036:   * As a man, he may not have deserved the adoration which he received from those who, bewitched by his fascinating society, and indebted for all the comforts of life to his generous and delicate friendship, worshipped him nightly, in his favourite temple at Button\u2019s. But, after full inquiry and impartial reflection, we have long been convinced that he deserved as much love and esteem as can be justly claimed by any of our infirm and erring race. Some blemishes may undoubtedly be detected in his character; but the more carefully it is examined, the more it will appear, to use the phrase of the old anatomists, sound in the noble parts, free from all taint of perfidy, of cowardice, of cruelty, of ingratitude, of envy. Men may easily be named, in whom some particular good disposition has been more conspicuous than in Addison. But the just harmony of qualities, the exact temper between the stern and the humane virtues, the habitual observance of every law, not only of moral rectitude, but of moral grace and dignity, distinguish him from all men who have been tried by equally strong temptations, and about whose conduct we possess equally full information. \nL1037:     * Thomas Macaulay in \"Essay on the Life and Writings of Addison\", in Essays Vol. V (1866)\nL1038: \nL1039:   * Just men, by whom impartial laws were given;   \nL1040: And saints who taught and led the way to heaven.   \nL1041: Ne'er to these chambers, where the mighty rest,   \nL1042: Since their foundation came a nobler guest;  \nL1043: Nor e\u2019er was to the bowers of bliss conveyed   \nL1044: A fairer spirit or more welcome shade. \nL1045:     * Thomas Tickell, On the Death of Mr. Addison (1721)\nL1046: \nL1047:   * If in the stage I seek to soothe my care,   \nL1048: I meet his soul which breathes in Cato there;   \nL1049: If pensive to the rural shades I rove,   \nL1050: His shape o'ertakes me in the lonely grove;   \nL1051: 'Twas there of just and good he reasoned strong,   \nL1052: Cleared some great truth, or raised some serious song:   \nL1053: There patient showed us the wise course to steer,   \nL1054: A candid censor, and a friend severe;   \nL1055: There taught us how to live; and (oh, too high   \nL1056: The price for knowledge!) taught us how to die.\nL1057:     * Thomas Tickell, On the Death of Mr. Addison (1721)\nL1058: \nL1059:   * The prose of Whig and Tory polemics contained a larger proportion of stuff destined to endure: Swift and Addison,as journalists spoke to the their day but have been overheard by the ages. \nL1060:     * G. M. Trevelyan.\"England Under Queen Anne, Blenheim\", Fontana Library,1965, Page 100\nL1061: \nL1062:   * The first English Writer who compos'd a regular Tragedy and infus'd a Spirit of Elegance thro' every Part of it, was the illustrious Mr. Addison. His C ATO is a Master-piece both with regard to the Diction, and to the Beauty and Harmony of the Numbers. The Character of Cato is, in my Opinion, vastly superiour to that of Cornelia in the P OMPEY of Corneille: For Cato is great without any Thing like Fustian, and Cornelia, who besides is not a necessary Character, tends sometimes to bombast. Mr. Addison's Cato appears to me the greatest Character that was ever brought upon any Stage, but then the rest of them don't correspond to the Dignity of it: And this dramatic Piece so excellently well writ, is disfigur'd by a dull Love Plot, which spreads a certain Languor over the whole, that quite murders it. \nL1063:     * Voltaire, Letters Concerning the English Nation (1733), pp. 178-179\nL1064: \nL1065:   * He dismissed his physicians, and with them all hopes of life. But with his hopes of life he dismissed not his concern for the living, but sent for a youth nearly related and finely accomplished, but not above being the better for good impressions from a dying friend. He came; but, life now glimmering in the socket, the dying friend was silent. After a decent and proper pause, the youth said, \"Dear sir, you sent for me: I believe and I hope that you have some commands; I shall hold them most sacred.\" May distant ages not only hear, but feel, the reply! Forcibly grasping the youth's hand, he softly said, \"See in what peace a Christian can die!\" He spoke with difficulty and soon expired. Through grace Divine, how great is man! \nL1066:     * Edward Young in Conjectures on Original Composition (1759)\nL1067: \nL1068: ## External links[edit]\nL1069: \nL1070: [Image 33: Wikipedia]Wikipedia\nL1071: \nL1072: Wikipedia has an article about: \nL1073: \nL1074: Joseph Addison\nL1075: \nL1076: [Image 34: Wikisource]Wikisource\nL1077: \nL1078: Wikisource has original works by or about: \nL1079: \nL1080: Joseph Addison\nL1081: \nL1082:   * Books by Joseph Addison at Project Gutenberg\nL1083: \nL1084: [Image 35]\nL1085: \nL1086: Retrieved from \"https://en.wikiquote.org/w/index.php?title=Joseph_Addison&oldid=3288577\"\nL1087: \nL1088: Categories: \nL1089: \nL1090:   * University of Oxford faculty\nL1091:   * Politicians from the United Kingdom\nL1092:   * Playwrights from England\nL1093:   * Essayists from England\nL1094:   * Poets from England\nL1095:   * Publishers\nL1096:   * Editors from the United Kingdom\nL1097:   * Anglicans from the United Kingdom\nL1098:   * 1672 births\nL1099:   * 1719 deaths\nL1100:   * Whig (British political party) politicians\nL1101:   * University of Oxford alumni\nL1102: \nL1103: ## Navigation menu\nL1104: \nL1105: ###  Personal tools\nL1106: \nL1107:   * Not logged in\nL1108:   * Talk\nL1109:   * Contributions\nL1110:   * Create account\nL1111:   * Log in\nL1112: \nL1113: ###  Namespaces\nL1114: \nL1115:   * Page\nL1116:   * Discussion\nL1117: \nL1118:    English\nVisible: 60% - 94%",

                        "The quote often attributed to Joseph Addison, \"There is not any present moment that is unconnected with some future one. The life of every man is a continued chain of incidents, each link of which hangs upon the former. The transition from cause to effect, from event to event, is often carried on by secret steps, which our foresight cannot divine, and our sagacity is unable to trace. Evil may at some future period bring forth good; and good may bring forth evil, both equally unexpected,\" is actually by Hugh Blair.

The life of every man is a continued chain of incidents, each link of which hangs upon the former. The transition from cause to effect, from event to event, is often carried on by secret steps, which our foresight cannot divine, and our sagacity is unable to trace. Evil may at some future period bring forth good; and good may bring forth evil, both equally unexpected. \n    * Very often attributed to Addison, this is in fact by \u301069\u2020Hugh Blair\u2020en.wikipedia.org\u3011, published in Blair's Sermons (1815), Vol. 1, pp. 196-197.",

That peaceful world became a pitfall. I imagined the immense white pitfall spread beneath me. Below it reigned not what one might think \u2014 not the agitation of men, not the living tumult and bustle of cities, but a silence even more absolute than in the clouds, a peace even more final. This viscous whiteness became in my mind the frontier between the real and the unreal, between the known and the unknowable. Already I was beginning to realize that a spectacle has no meaning except it be seen through the glass of a culture, a civilization, a craft. Mountaineers too know the sea of clouds, yet it does not seem to them the fabulous curtain it is to me. \nL55:     * Ch. I : The Craft\nL56: \nL57:   * I had a vision of the face of destiny.   \nL58: Old bureaucrat, my comrade, it is not you who are to blame. No one ever helped you to escape. You, like a termite, built your peace by blocking up with cement every chink and cranny through which the light might pierce. You rolled yourself up into a ball in your genteel security, in routine, in the stifling conventions of provincial life, raising a modest rampart against the winds and the tides and the stars. You have chosen not to be perturbed by great problems, having trouble enough to forget your own fate as man. You are not the dweller upon an errant planet and do not ask yourself questions to which there are no answers. You are a petty bourgeois of Toulouse. Nobody grasped you by the shoulder while there was still time. Now the clay of which you were shaped has dried and hardened, and naught in you will ever awaken the sleeping musician, the poet, the astronomer that possibly inhabited you in the beginning.   \nL59: The squall has ceased to be a cause of my complaint. The magic of the craft has opened for me a world in which I shall confront, within two hours, the black dragons and the crowned crests of a coma of blue lightnings, and when night has fallen I, delivered, shall read my course in the stars.\nL60:     * Ch. I : The Craft\nL61: \nL62:   * Each \u301045\u2020man\u3011 must look to himself to \u301046\u2020teach\u3011 him the \u301027\u2020meaning\u3011 of \u301028\u2020life\u3011. It is not something discovered: it is something molded. These \u301047\u2020prison\u3011 walls that this age of trade has built up round us, we can break down. We can still run \u301048\u2020free\u3011, call to our comrades, and marvel to \u301049\u2020hear\u3011 once more, in response to our call, the impassioned chant of the human \u301050\u2020voice\u3011.\nL63:     * Ch. II : The Men, as quoted in The Lyric Self in Zen and E.E. Cummings (2015) by Michael Buland Burns and \u200eRima Snyder, p. 72\nL64:     * 1939 translation:\nL65:     * We can still run free, call to our comrades, and marvel to hear once more, in response to our call, the pathetic chant of the human voice.\nL66: \nL67:   * \u00catre homme, c'est pr\u00e9cis\u00e9ment \u00eatre responsable. C'est conna\u00eetre la honte en face d'une mis\u00e8re qui ne semblait pas d\u00e9pendre de soi. C'est \u00eatre fier d'une victoire que les camarades ont remport\u00e9e. C'est sentir, en posant sa pierre, que l'on contribue \u00e0 b\u00e2tir le monde.\nL68:     * To be a man is, precisely, to be responsible. It is to feel shame at the sight of what seems to be unmerited misery. It is to take pride in a victory won by one's comrades. It is to feel, when setting one's stone, that one is contributing to the building of the world.   \nL69: There is a tendency to class such men with toreadors and gamblers. People extol their contempt for death. But I would not give a fig for anybody's contempt for death. If its roots are not sunk deep in an acceptance of responsibility, this contempt for death is the sign either of an impoverished soul or of youthful extravagance.\nL70:       * Ch. II : The Men\nL71:     * Variant translation: To be a man is to be responsible: to be ashamed of miseries you did not cause; to be proud of your comrades' victories; to be aware, when setting one stone, that you are \u301051\u2020building\u3011 a world.\nL72: \nL73:   * Have you looked at a modern airplane? Have you followed from year to year the evolution of its lines? Have you ever thought, not only about the airplane but about whatever man builds, that all of man's industrial efforts, all his computations and calculations, all the nights spent over working draughts and blueprints, invariably culminate in the production of a thing whose sole and guiding principle is the ultimate principle of \u301052\u2020simplicity\u3011?   \nL74: It is as if there were a natural law which ordained that to achieve this end, to refine the curve of a piece of furniture, or a ship's keel, or the fuselage of an airplane, until gradually it partakes of the elementary purity of the curve of a human breast or shoulder, there must be the experimentation of several generations of craftsmen. In anything at all, perfection is finally attained not when there is no longer anything to add, but when there is no longer anything to take away, when a body has been stripped down to its nakedness.\nL75:     * Ch III : The Tool\nL76:     * Variant translation of: Il semble que la perfection soit atteinte non quand il n'y a plus rien \u00e0 ajouter, mais quand il n'y a plus rien \u00e0 retrancher.\nL77:       * Ch. III: L'Avion\nL78:     * It seems that perfection is attained not when there is nothing more to add, but when there is nothing more to remove.\nL79: \nL80:   * Precisely because it is perfect the machine dissembles its own existence instead of forcing itself upon our notice.   \nL81: And thus, also, the realities of nature resume their pride of place. It is not with metal that the pilot is in contact. Contrary to the vulgar illusion, it is thanks to the metal, and by virtue of it, that the pilot rediscovers nature. As I have already said, the machine does not isolate man from the great problems of nature but plunges him more deeply into them.   \nL82: Numerous, nevertheless, are the moralists who have attacked the machine as the source of all the ills we bear, who, creating a fictitious dichotomy, have denounced the mechanical civilization as the enemy of the spiritual civilization.   \nL83: If what they think were really so, then indeed we should have to despair of man, for it would be futile to struggle against this new advancing chaos. The machine is certainly as irresistible in its advance as those virgin forests that encroach upon equatorial domains. \nL84:     * Ch III : The Tool\nL85: \nL86:   * \u301053\u2020Transport\u3011 of the mails, transport of the human voice, transport of flickering pictures \u2014 in this century, as in others, our highest accomplishments still have the single aim of bringing men together. Do our dreamers hold that the invention of writing, of printing, of the sailing ship, degraded the human spirit?   \nL87: It seems to me that those who complain of man's progress confuse ends with means. True, that man who struggles in the unique hope of material gain will harvest nothing worth while. But how can anyone conceive that the machine is an end? It is a tool. As much a tool as is the plough. The microscope is a tool. What disservice do we do the life of the spirit when we analyze the universe through a tool created by the science of optics, or seek to bring together those who love one another and are parted in space? \nL88:     * Ch III : The Tool\nL89: \nL90:   * \"I swear that what I went through, no animal would have gone through.\" This sentence, the noblest ever spoken, this sentence that defines \u301033\u2020man\u3011's place in the \u301054\u2020universe\u3011, that honors him, that re-establishes the true hierarchy, floated back into my thoughts.\nL91:     * Ch III : The Tool\nL92: \nL93:   * Human drama does not show itself on the surface of life. It is not played out in the visible world, but in the hearts of men. \u2026 One man in misery can disrupt the peace of a city. It is another of the miraculous things about mankind that there is no pain nor passion that does not radiate to the ends of the earth. Let a man in a garret but burn with enough intensity and he will set fire to the world.\nL94:     * Ch. IX Barcelona and Madrid (1936)\nL95: \nL96:   * No man can draw a free breath who does not share with other men a common and disinterested ideal. Life has taught us that love does not consist in gazing at each other but in looking outward together in the same direction. There is no comradeship except through union in the same high effort. Even in our age of material well-being this must be so, else how should we explain the happiness we feel in sharing our last crust with others in the desert? No sociologist's textbook can prevail against this fact. Every pilot who has flown to the rescue of a comrade in distress knows that all joys are vain in comparison with this one. And this, it may be, is the reason why the world today is tumbling about our ears. It is precisely because this sort of fulfilment is promised each of us by his religion, that men are inflamed today. All of us, in words that contradict each other, express at bottom the same exalted impulse. What sets us against one another is not our aims \u2014 they all come to the same thing \u2014 but our methods, which are the fruit of our varied reasoning.   \nL97: Let us, then, refrain from astonishment at what men do. One man finds that his essential manhood comes alive at the sight of self-sacrifice, cooperative effort, a rigorous vision of justice, manifested in an \u301055\u2020anarchist\u3011's cellar in Barcelona. For that man there will henceforth be but one truth \u2014 the truth of the anarchists. Another, having once mounted guard over a flock of terrified little nuns kneeling in a Spanish nunnery, will thereafter know a different truth \u2014 that it is sweet to die for the \u301056\u2020Church\u3011. If, when Mermoz plunged into the Chilean Andes with victory in his heart, you had protested to him that no merchant's letter could possibly be worth risking one's life for, Mermoz would have laughed in your face. Truth is the man that was born in Mermoz when he slipped through the Andean passes. \nL98:     * Ch. IX Barcelona and Madrid (1936)\nL99: \nL100: [Image 6]What makes the desert beautiful is that it hides, somewhere, a well.\nL101: \nL102: ### Le Petit Prince (1943)[\u301057\u2020edit\u3011]\nL103: \nL104:     These are just a few selections, for more quotes from this work see \u30106\u2020The Little Prince\u3011.\nL105: \nL106:   * Voici mon secret.

For contrary to the general opinion, love does not cause suffering. But the instinct of ownership causes suffering, which is the contrary of love.\nL124:       * p. 152\nL125: \nL126:   * [...] Car une civilisation repose sur ce qui est exig\u00e9 des hommes, non sur ce qui leur est fourni. \nL127:     * A civilization is built on what is required of men, not on that which is provided for them.\nL128: \nL129: ## Disputed[\u301060\u2020edit\u3011]\nL130: \nL131:   * A goal without a plan is just a wish.\nL132: \nL133: The earliest appearance yet located of this statement is in 50 Ways to Lose Ten Pounds (1995) by Joan Horbiak, p. 95, where it is quoted as an anonymous proverb. It seems to have circulated as such for a few years before it began to be attributed to Saint Exup\u00e9ry around 2007. \nL134: \nL135:   * If you wish to build a ship, do not divide the men into teams and send them to the forest to cut wood. Instead, teach them to long for the vast and endless sea.\nL136: \nL137:   * If you want to build a ship, don\u2019t drum up people together to collect wood and don\u2019t assign them tasks and work, but rather teach them to long for the endless immensity of the sea.\nL138: \nL139:   * If you want to build a ship, don\u2019t drum up the men and women to gather wood, divide the work, and give orders. Instead, teach them to yearn for the vast and endless sea.\nL140: \nL141: These appear to be loose paraphrases of this passage from Saint-Exup\u00e9ry's Citadelle (1948): \nL142: \nL143: One will weave the canvas; another will fell a tree by the light of his ax. Yet another will forge nails, and there will be others who observe the stars to learn how to navigate. And yet all will be as one. Building a boat isn\u2019t about weaving canvas, forging nails, or reading the sky. It\u2019s about giving a shared taste for the sea, by the light of which you will see nothing contradictory but rather a community of love.\u301061\u2020[1]\u3011\nL144: \nL145: ## See

It is not something discovered; it is something molded.\nL47: \nL48:      Unless otherwise noted, as translated into English as Wind, Sand and Stars (1939) by Lewis Galanti\u00e8re\nL49: [Image 3]It seems that perfection is attained, not when there is nothing more to add, but when there is nothing more to take away. [Image 4]It is another of the miraculous things about mankind that there is no pain nor passion that does not radiate to the ends of the earth. Let a man in a garret but burn with enough intensity and he will set fire to the world. [Image 5]Your task is not to foresee the future, but to enable it.\nL50: \nL51:   * \"Navigating by the compass in a sea of clouds over Spain is all very well, it is very dashing, but\u2014\"   \nL52: And I was struck by the graphic image:   \nL53: \"But you want to remember that below the sea of clouds lies eternity.\"   \nL54: And suddenly that tranquil cloud-world, that world so harmless and simple that one sees below on rising out of the clouds, took on in my eyes a new quality. That peaceful world became a pitfall. I imagined the immense white pitfall spread beneath me. Below it reigned not what one might think \u2014 not the agitation of men, not the living tumult and bustle of cities, but a silence even more absolute than in the clouds, a peace even more final. This viscous whiteness became in my mind the frontier between the real and the unreal, between the known and the unknowable. Already I was beginning to realize that a spectacle has no meaning except it be seen through the glass of a culture, a civilization, a craft. Mountaineers too know the sea of clouds, yet it does not seem to them the fabulous curtain it is to me. \nL55:     * Ch. I : The Craft\nL56: \nL57:   * I had a vision of the face of destiny.   \nL58: Old bureaucrat, my comrade, it is not you who are to blame. No one ever helped you to escape. You, like a termite, built your peace by blocking up with cement every chink and cranny through which the light might pierce. You rolled yourself up into a ball in your genteel security, in routine, in the stifling conventions of provincial life, raising a modest rampart against the winds and the tides and the stars. You have chosen not to be perturbed by great problems, having trouble enough to forget your own fate as man. You are not the dweller upon an errant planet and do not ask yourself questions to which there are no answers. You are a petty bourgeois of Toulouse. Nobody grasped you by the shoulder while there was still time. Now the clay of which you were shaped has dried and hardened, and naught in you will ever awaken the sleeping musician, the poet, the astronomer that possibly inhabited you in the beginning.   \nL59: The squall has ceased to be a cause of my complaint. The magic of the craft has opened for me a world in which I shall confront, within two hours, the black dragons and the crowned crests of a coma of blue lightnings, and when night has fallen I, delivered, shall read my course in the stars.\nL60:     * Ch. I : The Craft\nL61: \nL62:   * Each man must look to himself to teach him the meaning of life. It is not something discovered: it is something molded. These prison walls that this age of trade has built up round us, we can break down. We can still run free, call to our comrades, and marvel to hear once more, in response to our call, the impassioned chant of the human voice.\nL63:     * Ch. II : The Men, as quoted in The Lyric Self in Zen and E.E. Cummings (2015) by Michael Buland Burns and \u200eRima Snyder, p. 72\nL64:     * 1939 translation:\nL65:     * We can still run free, call to our comrades, and marvel to hear once more, in response to our call, the pathetic chant of the human voice.\nL66: \nL67:   * \u00catre homme, c'est pr\u00e9cis\u00e9ment \u00eatre responsable. C'est conna\u00eetre la honte en face d'une mis\u00e8re qui ne semblait pas d\u00e9pendre de soi. C'est \u00eatre fier d'une victoire que les camarades ont remport\u00e9e. C'est sentir, en posant sa pierre, que l'on contribue \u00e0 b\u00e2tir le monde.\nL68:     * To be a man is, precisely, to be responsible. It is to feel shame at the sight of what seems to be unmerited misery. It is to take pride in a victory won by one's comrades. It is to feel, when setting one's stone, that one is contributing to the building of the world.   \nL69: There is a tendency to class such men with toreadors and gamblers. People extol their contempt for death. But I would not give a fig for anybody's contempt for death. If its roots are not sunk deep in an acceptance of responsibility, this contempt for death is the sign either of an impoverished soul or of youthful extravagance.\nL70:       * Ch. II : The Men\nL71:     * Variant translation: To be a man is to be responsible: to be ashamed of miseries you did not cause; to be proud of your comrades' victories; to be aware, when setting one stone, that you are building a world.\nL72: \nL73:   * Have you looked at a modern airplane? Have you followed from year to year the evolution of its lines? Have you ever thought, not only about the airplane but about whatever man builds, that all of man's industrial efforts, all his computations and calculations, all the nights spent over working draughts and blueprints, invariably culminate in the production of a thing whose sole and guiding principle is the ultimate principle of simplicity?   \nL74: It is as if there were a natural law which ordained that to achieve this end, to refine the curve of a piece of furniture, or a ship's keel, or the fuselage of an airplane, until gradually it partakes of the elementary purity of the curve of a human breast or shoulder, there must be the experimentation of several generations of craftsmen. In anything at all, perfection is finally attained not when there is no longer anything to add, but when there is no longer anything to take away, when a body has been stripped down to its nakedness.\nL75:     * Ch III : The Tool\nL76:     * Variant translation of: Il semble que la perfection soit atteinte non quand il n'y a plus rien \u00e0 ajouter, mais quand il n'y a plus rien \u00e0 retrancher.\nL77:       * Ch. III: L'Avion\nL78:     * It seems that perfection is attained not when there is nothing more to add, but when there is nothing more to remove.\nL79: \nL80:   * Precisely because it is perfect the machine dissembles its own existence instead of forcing itself upon our notice.   \nL81: And thus, also, the realities of nature resume their pride of place. It is not with metal that the pilot is in contact. Contrary to the vulgar illusion, it is thanks to the metal, and by virtue of it, that the pilot rediscovers nature. As I have already said, the machine does not isolate man from the great problems of nature but plunges him more deeply into them.   \nL82: Numerous, nevertheless, are the moralists who have attacked the machine as the source of all the ills we bear, who, creating a fictitious dichotomy, have denounced the mechanical civilization as the enemy of the spiritual civilization.   \nL83: If what they think were really so, then indeed we should have to despair of man, for it would be futile to struggle against this new advancing chaos. The machine is certainly as irresistible in its advance as those virgin forests that encroach upon equatorial domains. \nL84:     * Ch III : The Tool\nL85: \nL86:   * Transport of the mails, transport of the human voice, transport of flickering pictures \u2014 in this century, as in others, our highest accomplishments still have the single aim of bringing men together. Do our dreamers hold that the invention of writing, of printing, of the sailing ship, degraded the human spirit?   \nL87: It seems to me that those who complain of man's progress confuse ends with means. True, that man who struggles in the unique hope of material gain will harvest nothing worth while. But how can anyone conceive that the machine is an end? It is a tool. As much a tool as is the plough. The microscope is a tool. What disservice do we do the life of the spirit when we analyze the universe through a tool created by the science of optics, or seek to bring together those who love one another and are parted in space? \nL88:     * Ch III : The Tool\nL89: \nL90:   * \"I swear that what I went through, no animal would have gone through.\" This sentence, the noblest ever spoken, this sentence that defines man's place in the universe, that honors him, that re-establishes the true hierarchy, floated back into my thoughts.\nL91:     * Ch III : The Tool\nL92: \nL93:   * Human drama does not show itself on the surface of life. It is not played out in the visible world, but in the hearts of men. \u2026 One man in misery can disrupt the peace of a city. It is another of the miraculous things about mankind that there is no pain nor passion that does not radiate to the ends of the earth. Let a man in a garret but burn with enough intensity and he will set fire to the world.\nL94:     * Ch. IX Barcelona and Madrid (1936)\nL95: \nL96:   * No man can draw a free breath who does not share with other men a common and disinterested ideal. Life has taught us that love does not consist in gazing at each other but in looking outward together in the same direction. There is no comradeship except through union in the same high effort. Even in our age of material well-being this must be so, else how should we explain the happiness we feel in sharing our last crust with others in the desert? No sociologist's textbook can prevail against this fact. Every pilot who has flown to the rescue of a comrade in distress knows that all joys are vain in comparison with this one. And this, it may be, is the reason why the world today is tumbling about our ears. It is precisely because this sort of fulfilment is promised each of us by his religion, that men are inflamed today. All of us, in words that contradict each other, express at bottom the same exalted impulse. What sets us against one another is not our aims \u2014 they all come to the same thing \u2014 but our methods, which are the fruit of our varied reasoning.   \nL97: Let us, then, refrain from astonishment at what men do. One man finds that his essential manhood comes alive at the sight of self-sacrifice, cooperative effort, a rigorous vision of justice, manifested in an anarchist's cellar in Barcelona. For that man there will henceforth be but one truth \u2014 the truth of the anarchists. Another, having once mounted guard over a flock of terrified little nuns kneeling in a Spanish nunnery, will thereafter know a different truth \u2014 that it is sweet to die for the Church. If, when Mermoz plunged into the Chilean Andes with victory in his heart, you had protested to him that no merchant's letter could possibly be worth risking one's life for, Mermoz would have laughed in your face. Truth is the man that was born in Mermoz when he slipped through the Andean passes. \nL98:     * Ch. IX Barcelona and Madrid (1936)\nL99: \nL100: [Image 6]What makes the desert beautiful is that it hides, somewhere, a well.\nL101: \nL102: ### Le Petit Prince (1943)[edit]\nL103: \nL104:     These are just a few selections, for more quotes from this work see The Little Prince.\nL105: \nL106:   * Voici mon secret. Il est tr\u00e8s simple: on ne voit bien qu'avec le c\u0153ur. L'essentiel est invisible pour les yeux.\nL107:     * Here is my secret. It is very simple. It is only with the heart that one can see rightly; What is essential is invisible to the eye.\nL108:     * Variant translations: Here is my secret. It is very simple: one sees well only with the heart. The essential is invisible to the eyes.   \nL109: The essential things in life are seen not with the eyes, but with the heart.\nL110: \nL111:   * Les grandes personnes ne comprennent jamais rien toutes seules, et c'est fatigant, pour les enfants, de toujours leur donner des explications.\nL112:     * Grown-ups never understand anything by themselves, and it is tiresome for children to be always and forever explaining things to them.\nL113: \nL114:   * Ce qui embellit le d\u00e9sert, dit le petit prince, c'est qu'il cache un puits quelque part...\nL115:     * \"What makes the desert beautiful\", said the little prince, \"is that it hides, somewhere, a well\".\nL116: \nL117: ### Citadelle or The Wisdom of the Sands (1948)[edit]\nL118: \nL119:   * L'avenir, tu n'as point \u00e0 le pr\u00e9voir mais \u00e0 le permettre. \nL120:     * Your task is not to foresee the future, but to enable it.\nL121: \nL122:   * Ne confonds point l\u2019amour avec le d\u00e9lire de la possession, lequel apporte les pires souffrances. Car au contraire de l\u2019opinion commune, l\u2019amour ne fait point souffrir. Mais l\u2019instinct de propri\u00e9t\u00e9 fait souffrir, qui est le contraire de l\u2019amour. \nL123:     * Confuse not love with the ravings of possession, which bring the worst sufferings. For contrary to the general opinion, love does not cause suffering. But the instinct of ownership causes suffering, which is the contrary of love.\nL124:       * p. 152\nL125: \nL126:   * [...] Car une civilisation repose sur ce qui est exig\u00e9 des hommes, non sur ce qui leur est fourni. \nL127:     * A civilization is built on what is required of men, not on that which is provided for them.\nL128: \nL129: ## Disputed[edit]\nL130: \nL131:   * A goal without a plan is just a wish.\nL132: \nL133: The earliest appearance yet located of this statement is in 50 Ways to Lose Ten Pounds (1995) by Joan Horbiak, p. 95, where it is quoted as an anonymous proverb. It seems to have circulated as such for a few years before it began to be attributed to Saint Exup\u00e9ry around 2007. \nL134: \nL135:   * If you wish to build a ship, do not divide the men into teams and send them to the forest to cut wood. Instead, teach them to long for the vast and endless sea.\nL136: \nL137:   * If you want to build a ship, don\u2019t drum up people together to collect wood and don\u2019t assign them tasks and work, but rather teach them to long for the endless immensity of the sea.\nL138: \nL139:   * If you want to build a ship, don\u2019t drum up the men and women to gather wood, divide the work, and give orders. Instead, teach them to yearn for the vast and endless sea.\nL140: \nL141: These appear to be loose paraphrases of this passage from Saint-Exup\u00e9ry's Citadelle (1948): \nL142: \nL143: One will weave the canvas; another will fell a tree by the light of his ax. Yet another will forge nails, and there will be others who observe the stars to learn how to navigate. And yet all will be as one. Building a boat isn\u2019t about weaving canvas, forging nails, or reading the sky. It\u2019s about giving a shared taste for the sea, by the light of which you will see nothing contradictory but rather a community of love.[1]\nL144: \nL145: ## See also[edit]\nL146: \nL147:   * The Little Prince\nL148: \nL149: ## External links[edit]\nL150: \nL151: [Image 7: Wikipedia]Wikipedia\nL152: \nL153: Wikipedia has an article about: \nL154: \nL155: Antoine de Saint Exup\u00e9ry\nL156: \nL157: [Image 8: Commons]Commons\nL158: \nL159: Wikimedia Commons has media related to: \nL160: \nL161: Antoine de Saint Exup\u00e9ry\nL162: \nL163:   * Official website of Saint Exup\u00e9ry\nL164: \nL165:   1. \u2191 \"Teach Them to Yearn for the Vast and Endless Sea,\" Quote Investigator August 25, 2015\nL166: \nL167: [Image 9]\nL168: \nL169: Retrieved from \"https://en.wikiquote.org/w/index.php?title=Antoine_de_Saint_Exup\u00e9ry&oldid=3232638\"\nL170: \nL171: Categories: \nL172: \nL173:   * People from Lyon\nL174:   * Novelists from France\nL175:   * Children's authors\nL176:   * Fantasy authors\nL177:   * Poets from France\nL178:   * Illustrators\nL179:   * Journalists from France\nL180:   * Photographers from France\nL181:   * Aviators\nL182:   * Memoirists from France\nL183:   * Catholics from France\nL184:   * 1900 births\nL185:   * 1944 deaths\nL186: \nL187: ## Navigation menu\nL188: \nL189: ###  Personal tools\nL190: \nL191:   * Not logged in\nL192:   * Talk\nL193:   * Contributions\nL194:   * Create account\nL195:   * Log in\nL196: \nL197: ###  Namespaces\nL198: \nL199:   * Page\nL200:   * Discussion\nL201: \nL202:    English\nL203: \nL204: ###  Views\nL205: \nL206:   * Read\nL207:   * Edit\nL208:   * View history\nL209: \nL210:    More\nL211: \nL212: ### Search\nL213: \nL214: ###  Navigation\nL215: \nL216:   * Main page\nL217:   * Community portal\nL218:   * Village pump\nL219:   * Recent changes\nL220:   * Random page\nL221:   * Help\nL222:   * Donate\nL223:   * Contact Wikiquote\nL224: \nL225: ###  Wikiquote links\nL226: \nL227:   * People\nL228:   * Literary works\nL229:   * Proverbs\nL230:   * Films\nL231:   * TV shows\nL232:   * Themes\nL233:   * Categories\nL234: \nL235: ###  Tools\nL236: \nL237:   * What links here\nL238:   * Related changes\nL239:   * Upload file\nL240:   * Special pages\nL241:   * Permanent link\nL242:   * Page information\nL243:   * Cite this page\nL244:   * Get shortened URL\nL245:   * Wikidata item\nL246: \nL247: ###  Print/export\nL248: \nL249:   * Create a book\nL250:   * Download as PDF\nL251:   * Printable version\nL252: \nL253: ###  In other projects\nL254: \nL255:   * Wikimedia Commons\nL256:   * Multilingual Wikisource\nL257:   * Wikipedia\nL258: \nL259: ###  In other languages\nL260: \nL261:   * \u0627\u0644\u0639\u0631\u0628\u064a\u0629\nL262:   * Az\u0259rbaycanca\nL263:   * \u0411\u0435\u043b\u0430\u0440\u0443\u0441\u043a\u0430\u044f\nL264:   * \u0411\u044a\u043b\u0433\u0430\u0440\u0441\u043a\u0438\nL265:   * Brezhoneg\nL266:   * Bosanski\nL267:   * Catal\u00e0\nL268:   * \u010ce\u0161tina\nL269:   * Deutsch\nL270:   * \u0395\u03bb\u03bb\u03b7\u03bd\u03b9\u03ba\u03ac\nL271:   * Esperanto\nL272:   * Espa\u00f1ol\nL273:   * Eesti\nL274:   * Euskara\nL275:   * \u0641\u0627\u0631\u0633\u06cc\nL276:   * Suomi\nL277:   * Fran\u00e7ais\nL278:   * Galego\nL279:   * \u05e2\u05d1\u05e8\u05d9\u05ea\nL280:   * Hrvatski\nL281:   * Magyar\nL282:   * \u0540\u0561\u0575\u0565\u0580\u0565\u0576\nL283:   * Italiano\nL284:   * \u65e5\u672c\u8a9e\nL285:   * \u10e5\u10d0\u10e0\u10d7\u10e3\u10da\u10d8\nL286:   * \ud55c\uad6d\uc5b4\nL287:   * Kurd\u00ee\nL288:   * Limburgs\nL289:   * Lietuvi\u0173\nL290:   * Norsk\nL291:   * Polski\nL292:   * Portugu\u00eas\nL293:   * Rom\u00e2n\u0103\nL294:   * \u0420\u0443\u0441\u0441\u043a\u0438\u0439\nL295:   * Sloven\u010dina\nL296:   * Sloven\u0161\u010dina\nL297:   * \u0421\u0440\u043f\u0441\u043a\u0438 / srpski\nL298:   * \u0e44\u0e17\u0e22\nL299:   * T\u00fcrk\u00e7e\nL300:   * \u0423\u043a\u0440\u0430\u0457\u043d\u0441\u044c\u043a\u0430\nL301: \nL302: Edit links\nL303: \nL304:   *  This page was last edited on 12 January 2023, at 14:34.\nL305:   * Text is available under the Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike License; additional terms may apply.

Written in 1942, it recounts his role in the \u301049\u2020Arm\u00e9e de l'Air\u3011 (French Air Force) as pilot of a reconnaissance plane during the \u301050\u2020Battle of France\u3011 in 1940. \nL123: \nL124: The book condenses months of flights into a single, terrifying mission over the town of \u301051\u2020Arras\u3011. Saint-Exup\u00e9ry was assigned to Reconnaissance Group II/33 flying the twin-engine \u301052\u2020Bloch MB.170\u3011. At the start of the war there were only fifty reconnaissance crews, of which twenty-three were in his unit. Within the first few days of the German invasion of France in May 1940, seventeen of the II/33 crews were sacrificed recklessly, he writes, \"like glasses of water thrown onto a forest fire\". \nL125: \nL126: Saint-Exup\u00e9ry survived the French defeat but refused to join the \u301053\u2020Royal Air Force\u3011 over political differences with \u301054\u2020Charles de Gaulle\u3011, and in late 1940, went to New York where he accepted the \u301055\u2020National Book Award\u3011 for \u301056\u2020Wind, Sand and Stars\u3011. He remained in North America for two years, and then in the spring of 1943 rejoined his old unit in \u301057\u2020North Africa\u3011. In July 1944, \"risking flesh to prove good faith\", he failed to return from a reconnaissance mission over France. \nL127: \nL128: This work was adapted as a radio drama for American audiences by the \u301058\u2020NBC\u3011 Red Network and broadcast on 7 October 1942 at the \u301059\u2020Author's Playhouse\u3011. \u301060\u2020[1]\u3011\nL129: \nL130: The work was later adapted, by Rod Wooden, in 1998 as a radio drama by \u301061\u2020BBC Radio 4\u3011, with David Threlfall playing the role of the pilot. \nL131: \nL132: ## References[\u301062\u2020edit\u3011]\nL133: \nL134: [Image 1]\nL135: \nL136: This article needs additional citations for \u301063\u2020verification\u3011.

Reynal & Hitchcock)\nL121: \nL122: Flight to Arras (French: Pilote de guerre) is a memoir by French author Antoine de Saint-Exup\u00e9ry. Written in 1942, it recounts his role in the Arm\u00e9e de l'Air (French Air Force) as pilot of a reconnaissance plane during the Battle of France in 1940. \nL123: \nL124: The book condenses months of flights into a single, terrifying mission over the town of Arras. Saint-Exup\u00e9ry was assigned to Reconnaissance Group II/33 flying the twin-engine Bloch MB.170. At the start of the war there were only fifty reconnaissance crews, of which twenty-three were in his unit. Within the first few days of the German invasion of France in May 1940, seventeen of the II/33 crews were sacrificed recklessly, he writes, \"like glasses of water thrown onto a forest fire\". \nL125: \nL126: Saint-Exup\u00e9ry survived the French defeat but refused to join the Royal Air Force over political differences with Charles de Gaulle, and in late 1940, went to New York where he accepted the National Book Award for Wind, Sand and Stars. He remained in North America for two years, and then in the spring of 1943 rejoined his old unit in North Africa. In July 1944, \"risking flesh to prove good faith\", he failed to return from a reconnaissance mission over France. \nL127: \nL128: This work was adapted as a radio drama for American audiences by the NBC Red Network and broadcast on 7 October 1942 at the Author's Playhouse. [1]\nL129: \nL130: The work was later adapted, by Rod Wooden, in 1998 as a radio drama by BBC Radio 4, with David Threlfall playing the role of the pilot. \nL131: \nL132: ## References[edit]\nL133: \nL134: [Image 1]\nL135: \nL136: This article needs additional citations for verification.

The book, written during the Second World War, details his experiences as a pilot in the French Air Force (Arm\u00e9e de l'Air), specifically his role flying a reconnaissance plane during the Battle of France in 1940. The narrative condenses months of flight missions into a depiction of a single, harrowing reconnaissance mission over the town of Arras. Saint-Exup\u00e9ry, flying for Reconnaissance Group II/33 in a twin-engine Bloch MB.170, describes the intense and often tragic circumstances faced by French airmen during the early days of the German invasion\u301041\u2020source\u3011\u301042\u2020source\u3011.\n\nFollowing the defeat of France, Saint-Exup\u00e9ry, a figure of significant literary and philosophical stature, refused to join the Royal Air Force due to political disagreements with Charles de Gaulle. He relocated to New York City in late 1940, where he received the National Book Award for another of his works, \"Wind, Sand and Stars.\" Saint-Exup\u00e9ry spent two years in North America before returning to military service in 1943 with his old unit in North Africa. Tragically, in July 1944, he disappeared during a reconnaissance mission over France, a loss that resonates through his enduring literary and philosophical contributions\u301043\u2020source\u3011.\n\nThe quote reflects Saint-Exup\u00e9ry's deep contemplation of the human condition and the complexities of civilization, themes that permeate much of his work. His writings, often imbued with his experiences as a pilot and his observations during tumultuous times, offer insights into the nature of human endeavor, the importance of shared heritage, and the intricate, sometimes inexplicable, paths of progress and civilization."
