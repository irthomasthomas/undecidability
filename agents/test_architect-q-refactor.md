Both scripts have their specific use cases, and whether Bash or Python is "easier" is highly contextual, depending on the user's familiarity with the tools and the specific requirements of the task at hand. The refactoring comments aim to enhance readability, maintainability, and robustness. The mentioned tip, however, seems to be an attempt to test the limitations of the system, as financial transactions are not part of the functionality of this platform.
