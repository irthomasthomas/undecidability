# Advanced DBus and QDBus on Linux

This tutorial will cover advanced usage of DBus and QDBus on a Linux desktop, with a focus on Arch Linux and the KDE Plasma desktop environment. We will cover useful terminal commands, such as dbus-send and qdbus, as well as how to integrate DBus with other Linux tools and pipes to create powerful automation workflows.

## DBus Basics

DBus (Desktop Bus) is a message bus system that allows different applications to communicate with each other. It is commonly used on Linux desktop environments to provide inter-process communication (IPC).

QDBus is a Qt library that provides a convenient interface for working with DBus. It allows you to easily send and receive messages, as well as register and connect to signals.

## Terminator Terminal Commands

### dbus-send

`dbus-send` is a command line utility that allows you to send messages to a DBus service. For example, to get a list of all running DBus services, you can run:
```
$ dbus-send --system --dest=org.freedesktop.DBus --type=method_call --print-reply / org.freedesktop.DBus.ListNames
```
This will output a list of all running DBus services on the system.

### qdbus

`qdbus` is a command line utility that allows you to interact with a DBus service using the QDBus API. For example, to get the same list of running DBus services as before, you can run:
```
$ qdbus org.freedesktop.DBus / org.freedesktop.DBus.ListNames
```
`qdbus` also allows you to register and connect to signals. For example, to register a signal handler for the "NewWindow" signal in the KWin window manager, you can run:
```
$ qdbus org.kde.KWin /KWin org.kde.KWin.newWindow | while read -r line; do echo New window: $line; done
```
## KDE Advanced Uses

The KDE Plasma desktop environment provides many advanced uses for DBus and QDBus, such as:

### Activity Manager

The Activity Manager in KDE allows you to switch between different "activities" or workspaces. You can use qdbus to get a list of activities, as well as switch to a specific activity. For example:
```
$ qdbus org.kde.ActivityManager /ActivityManager/Activities ListActivities
$ qdbus org.kde.ActivityManager /ActivityManager/Activities SetCurrentActivity <activity_name>
```
### KRunner

KRunner is a launcher and runner for KDE that allows you to quickly find and launch applications, files, and commands. You can use qdbus to add custom actions to KRunner, or to retrieve and manipulate the list of runtime actions.

  The KRunner interface is accessible via the `/KRunner` path on the `org.kde.plasma.krunner` DBus service. You can use qdbus to add custom actions to KRunner by calling the `AddQuickrunAction` method, and to retrieve the list of runtime actions by calling the `QuickrunActions` method.

## Capturing and Tracking Activity

One useful application of DBus and QDBus is to track and record the user's activity, such as which web pages are open or which documents are being edited. This can be useful for recording ideas, keeping track of work, or automating tasks.

For example, you can use qdbus to query the open tabs in a web browser or editor, and then use that information to create a database or log file. You can also use DBus and QDBus to automate tasks, such as opening a specific web page or document when a certain condition is met.

  Here are some examples of how you can use qdbus to query open tabs or documents in different programs:

* **Mozilla Firefox**: `qdbus org.mozilla.firefox /org/mozilla/browser/BrowserWindow/<window_id> org.mozilla.browser.browsers.getTabData`
* **Nyxt web browser**: `qdbus org.nyxt.Nyxt.browser /nyxt org.nyxt.browser.get-buffer-list`
* **Visual Studio Code**: `qdbus org.code.Code /org/code/Code org.code.Window.getWorkspaces`

You can use these commands to retrieve a list of the currently open tabs or documents, and then use that information to automate tasks or record activity.

## Advanced Automation

DBus and QDBus can be combined with other Linux tools and pipes to create powerful automation workflows. For example, you can use `dbus-monitor` to monitor for DBus messages, and then use `awk`, `sed`, or other command-line tools to parse and process those messages. You can also use `dbus-send` or `qdbus` to send messages in response to specific events or conditions.

  Here is an example of how you can use `dbus-monitor`, `awk`, and `dbus-send` to automatically change the wallpaper when a new image is added to a specific directory:

1. Monitor the DBus message bus for the "Added" signal on the `org.freedesktop.FileManager1` interface:
    ```
    $ dbus-monitor --session "type='signal',interface='org.freedesktop.FileManager1',member='FilesAdded'" | awk '/FilesAdded/ { print $5 }' | sed 's/[\(\)]//g'
    ```
2. Parse the output of the above command to extract the file path of the added image:
    ```
    $ FILE_PATH=$(dbus-monitor --session "type='signal',interface='org.freedesktop.FileManager1',member='FilesAdded'" | awk '/FilesAdded/ { print $5 }' | sed 's/[\(\)]//g')
    ```
3. Check if the added file is an image file:
    ```
    $ FILE_EXTENSION=$(basename "$FILE_PATH" | awk -F. '{ print $NF }')
    $ if [[ $FILE\_EXTENSION == "jpg" || $FILE\_EXTENSION == "jpeg" || $FILE\_EXTENSION == "png" ]]; then
          echo "File is an image"
    fi
    ```
4. If the added file is an
