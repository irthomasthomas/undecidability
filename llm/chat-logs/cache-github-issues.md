# Script to Download and Store GitHub Issues

This script allows you to download all GitHub issues for your repository and store them in memory for fast access. It uses the GitHub CLI (gh) or GitHub API to retrieve as much information as available about the issues.

## Prerequisites

- GitHub CLI (gh) installed and authenticated with your GitHub account.

## Instructions

1. Clone or download the script repository.
2. Install the required dependencies.
3. Run the script by executing the main file.

## Usage

`python main.py [--refresh]`

- The `--refresh` flag initiates a check for new issues, downloading any that are found.

## Additional Features

- Supports periodic checks for new issues.
- Option to manually trigger a check for new issues.
- Option to specify the repository where issues should be downloaded from.

## Next Steps

- Consider integrating the script into a larger workflow or automation system.
- Explore additional GitHub API features for more advanced issue management.
- Build a front-end interface for easier issue access and management.
