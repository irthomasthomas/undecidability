**Prompt:**
how to get the start time?

**Response:**
You can get the start time of a process in Linux by using the `ps` command followed by the PID. Here's how to do it:

1. Open your terminal.

2. Use the `ps` command with `-o` option to customize the output format and `lstart` to display the start time. For example, if your PID is 1234, you would type:

```
ps -p 1234 -o lstart=
```

This will display the start time of the process with the PID 1234.

Note: The equal sign (=) after `lstart` is to remove the header from output. If you do need the header, you can simply write it as `lstart`.
