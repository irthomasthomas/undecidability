**Prompt:**
rm an alias

**Response:**
To remove an alias in the Unix/Linux terminal, you can use the `unalias` command followed by the alias name. Here's how you can do it:

1. Open a terminal.
2. Type `unalias alias_name` and replace `alias_name` with the name of the alias you want to remove.
3. Press Enter.

For example, if you have an alias called `ll` for the `ls -l` command and you want to remove it, you would run the command `unalias ll`.
