**Prompt:**
quickly, how to make a global bash or shell alias for all users?. say nothing else.

**Response:**
To create a global bash or shell alias for all users, add the alias command to the system-wide bashrc or profile file.

For example, on most Linux distributions:

1. Open the terminal.
2. Switch to the root user using the command: `sudo su`.
3. Edit the global bashrc file using a text editor like nano or vi: `nano /etc/bashrc` or `vi /etc/bashrc`.
4. Add the desired alias in the file, for instance: `alias myalias='command'`.
5. Save the changes and exit the editor (in nano, press Ctrl + X, then Y, then Enter).
6. Test the alias by opening a new terminal window and running the alias command.

Note: Depending on the distribution and shell being used, the file name and location may vary (e.g., `/etc/bash.bashrc`, `/etc/profile`, etc.). Please refer to your system's documentation for the specific file name and location.
