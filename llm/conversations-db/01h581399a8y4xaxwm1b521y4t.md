**Prompt:**
quickly, how to add a global, system-wide alias for all users on manjaro? say nothing else.

**Response:**
To add a global, system-wide alias for all users on Manjaro, you should add the alias to the `/etc/bash.bashrc` file. As an example, to add an alias `cl` for `clear` command, open the bashrc file with a text editor like nano:

```bash
sudo nano /etc/bash.bashrc
```

And then add the following line at the bottom:

```bash
alias cl='clear'
```

Save and exit the file (CTRL + X, then hit Y and Enter to save changes). Now, the `cl` alias should be available to all users. However, they need to restart their shell session (or source ~/.bashrc) for changes to take effect.
