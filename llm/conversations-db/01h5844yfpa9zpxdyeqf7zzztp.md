  Subdevices: 1/1
  Subdevice #0: subdevice #0

  Subdevices: 1/1
  Subdevice #0: subdevice #0? Say nothing else. # [manjaro, arch, kde=5.20, kernel=6.0, python=3.09]

**Response:**
To record from your microphone in bash, you can use the following command:

```bash
arecord -f cd -t wav -d 10 -D hw:1,0 filename.wav
```

This command uses the `arecord` utility to capture audio from the specified hardware device (`hw:1,0` in this case) and saves it to a WAV file named `filename.wav`. The options `-f cd -t wav` set the audio format to CD quality WAV, and `-d 10` specifies a duration of 10 seconds for the recording.

Note: You may need to adjust the hardware device (`hw:1,0`) according to your specific system configuration.
