**Prompt:**
Explain: str->str_pok |= SP_FBM;                     /* deep magic */
s = (unsigned char*)(str->str_ptr);         /* deeper magic */
                -- Larry Wall in util.c from the perl source code

**Response:**
In the given code, Larry Wall, the creator of Perl language, has made some subtle comments indicating that the line of code may seem complex and challenging to understand.

`str->str_pok |= SP_FBM; /* deep magic */`
This line is performing a bitwise OR operation and assignment. It's taking the existing value of `str->str_pok` and performing a bitwise OR operation with `SP_FBM` (presumably a macro or constant), and then storing the result back in `str->str_pok`. It essentially sets the `SP_FBM` bit in `str->str_pok`.

In context of Perl Internals, `SP_FBM` is likely a flag that indicates some state or attribute of the string. The name `SP_FBM` is an abbreviation for "string pointer fast boyer-moore", a fast string-matching algorithm. The `str_pok` is a field in the Perl string structure which keeps track of various flags.

`s = (unsigned char*)(str->str_ptr); /* deeper magic */`
This line is casting `str->str_ptr` to an `unsigned char` pointer, and then assigning it to `s`. This is essentially creating a new way to view or interpret the memory that `str->str_ptr` is pointing to. 

This sort of thing is often done when you want to manipulate the memory in a way that the original data type doesn't easily or conveniently allow. For instance, you might cast an object pointer to a `char` pointer when you want to examine or modify the individual bytes of the object.

The reason these two lines of codes are referred as "deep magic" and "deeper magic" is a kind of tongue-in-cheek way of acknowledging that this kind of low-level bit manipulation and type casting is quite tricky and can seem almost magical if you're not deeply familiar with these concepts. 

Lastly, it's worth noting that these comments also reflect the humor and literary style of Larry Wall, a linguist by training, who is known for his playful and erudite commentary in code and in person.
