path=$1

# Get the last modified file in the given path
lastfile=$(ls -lt $path | awk 'NR==2{print $NF}')

# Prompt user for confirmation before deleting the last file
read -p "Are you sure you want to delete '$lastfile'? (y/n): " confirm

# Check user's confirmation and proceed accordingly
if [ "$confirm" == "y" ]; then
    rm "$path/$lastfile"
    echo "'$lastfile' has been deleted."

    echo "Deletion cancelled. '$lastfile' was not deleted."
