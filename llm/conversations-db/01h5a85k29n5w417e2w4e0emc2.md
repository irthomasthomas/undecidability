SAY NOTHING ELSE

**Response:**
Here is the requested bash script:

```bash
#!/bin/bash

# Take a path as $1 input
path=$1

# Get the last modified file in the given path
lastfile=$(ls -lt "$path" | awk 'NR==2 {print $NF}')

# Ask for user confirmation before deleting the last file
read -p "Are you sure you want to delete '$lastfile'? [y/n]: " confirm
confirm=$(echo "$confirm" | tr '[:upper:]' '[:lower:]')

# If confirmation is given, delete the file
if [ "$confirm" = "y" ]; then
    rm "$path/$lastfile"
    echo "File '$lastfile' deleted successfully."
else
    echo "Deletion of file '$lastfile' cancelled."
fi
```

Please note that this script assumes the user has the necessary permissions to delete the file. Additionally, it does not handle cases where the provided path is invalid or if there are no files in the directory.
