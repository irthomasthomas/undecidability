**Prompt:**
what does declare do?

**Response:**
The `declare` command in Bash is used to declare variables and give them attributes. It can be used to define variables as local or global, assign values to variables, and set attributes such as readonly, integer, etc.

In the provided script, `declare -f` is used to retrieve the function signature of the `coolbin` function. This means it will output the function definition, including any local variables and their values. The output of `declare -f` is then stored in the `function_signature` variable and included in the metadata file along with other information about the tool.

Note that the `-f` option is used specifically for functions. If you use `declare` without the `-f` option, it will display the attributes and values of variables.
