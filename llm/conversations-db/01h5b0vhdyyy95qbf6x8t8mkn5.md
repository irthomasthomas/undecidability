**Prompt:**
Quickly, what is the exact bash command to change the app assigned as the editor for text files in konsole. Using Manjaro/Arch Linux,Kernel 6,KDE Plasma 5.2,QT5,Python 3.10?
Reply only with the exact command text and nothing else before or after.

**Response:**
There is no specific bash command to change the app assigned as the editor for text files in konsole. However, you can use the `xdg-mime` command to set the default application for opening text files. 

The exact command text is:

```bash
xdg-mime default <app.desktop> text/plain
```

Replace `<app.desktop>` with the desktop entry file of the desired application (e.g., `kate.desktop` for Kate text editor).
