**Prompt:**
Think it through carefully.
I wish to create an index of the tools available in my linux path. The index should contain information to help me find and use the tools.
Start by listing the type of information that can be obtained and used for a linux binary?
Let's reason it through step-by-step.

**Response:**
Creating an index of Linux tools by obtaining and organizing relevant information is an effective way to utilize system resources. Here is the list of the type of information you might want to obtain and use for a Linux binary:

1. Name: It's the most basic piece of information for any Linux binary. The name of the command or tool is what you would use to call it from the command line.

2. Location: The location or path where the binary is located within your Linux system. 

3. File Type: This indicates if it is an executable binary, shell script, a symbolic link, or a text file.

4. File Size: The disk space the binary file is occupying.

5. Permissions: The read, write, and execute permissions related to the binary.

6. Owner Information: This includes the owner and the group that owns the file.

7. Modification Date & Time: The last time the file got modified.

8. Inode number: Every file has an index node number, referring to a unique inode in a table. 

9. Number of Links: It identifies the number of hard links to the file.

10. Manual or Help: Usage information for the tool obtained from its man or --help pages, providing details on how to use the tool, its features, and options.

To gather this information, you can utilize various Linux commands such as `ls`, `man`, `file`, `which`, `whereis`, `du`, `help`, etc. It's crucial to remember that all these commands provide different kinds of information, and integrating them is the key to creating a comprehensive and useful index.
  
Once you have gathered these data pieces, you can create a script or a program to automate the process of updating the index as the tools in your Linux PATH change over time.
