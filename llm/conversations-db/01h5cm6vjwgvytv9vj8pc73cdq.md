**Prompt:**
for dir in ${(s.:.)PATH}; do for file in $dir/*; do echo $file; done; done results in error: no matches found: /usr/local/bin/*

**Response:**
The command you mentioned is a zsh command that is used to list all files in each directory in your PATH.

The error "no matches found: /usr/local/bin/*" is caused by the shell's "nomatch" option being set. In zsh, when a glob pattern (like /usr/local/bin/*) does not match any files, and the "nomatch" option is set, it will cause an error. 

To avoid this error, you can unset the "nomatch" option, or use a more fundamental way to check the existence of the files before trying to echo them. Here's an improved command that won't trigger an error when a directory is empty:

```bash
for dir in ${(s.:.)PATH}; do 
    for file in ${(M)${(z)$(< <( echo $dir/*(N)))}/*}; do 
        echo $file; 
    done; 
done
```

This slightly more complex command first expands the `$dir/*(N)` glob with the `(N)` qualifying expansion, which means "null glob": it expands to a null string (not an error) when there's no match.

Another option is to just silence the error messages using `2> /dev/null`:

```bash
for dir in ${(s.:.)PATH}; do 
    for file in $dir/* 2> /dev/null; do 
        echo $file; 
    done; 
done
```
Note: these are specific to zsh. The behavior in other shells like bash may vary. Be aware of which shell you're using when running these commands.
