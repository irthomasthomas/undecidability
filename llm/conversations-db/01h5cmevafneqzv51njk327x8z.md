zsh: no matches found: /usr/local/bin/*

**Response:**
I apologize, but the command you provided seems to be written in Zsh syntax, not Bash. In Zsh, when using globbing, you need to change the behavior by including the `null_glob` option. Here's the modified command to run in Zsh:

```bash
setopt null_glob
for dir in ${(s.:.)PATH}; do for file in $dir/*; do echo $file; done; done
```

**Prompt:**
zsh: no matches found: /usr/local/bin/*

**Response:**
I apologize for the confusion, the problem here is with the zsh option `nomatch` which is probably set in your shell where it aborts when filename generation (filename globbing) has no match. You can overcome this issue by using the `N` globbing qualifier that will ignore the error if no match is found.

Please try the following command:

```
for dir in ${(s.:.)PATH}; do for file in $dir/*(N); do echo $file; done; done
```
