Quickly, what is the exact bash command to The arrow keys are awkwardly placed on my keyboard. suggest a way remap my keyboard so I don't need to press the right arrow (for a start).?
Reply only with the exact command text and nothing else before or after.

**Response:**
You can't remap keys using a single bash command. It involves modifying keymap files or using tools like xbindkeys, xmodmap, setxkbmap or dconf-editor, which is not a straightforward process and might require system restart or X server restart. Therefore, providing this as a single command is not possible.
