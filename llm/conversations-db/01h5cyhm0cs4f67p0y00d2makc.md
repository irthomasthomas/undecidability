**Prompt:**
Using Manjaro/Arch Linux,Kernel 6,KDE Plasma 5.2,QT5,Python 3.10  The arrow keys are awkwardly placed on my keyboard. suggest a way remap my keyboard so I don't need to press the right arrow (for a start).

**Response:**
You can accomplish this by using the Xmodmap utility. Here's a short guide to help you map the right arrow function to another key (let's assume you want to map it to the right shift key):

1. First, you need to find the keycode for the corresponding keys you want to re-bind. To find out the keycode, you can use the utility `xev`. Open your terminal and type:

   ```sh
   xev | grep keycode
   ```
   You will see an empty window opening up and you will see key press and key release events in your terminal when you press any key. So, press the right shift key and note down the keycode.

2. Using Xmodmap:

   - Create a .Xmodmap file in your home directory if it doesn't already exist.
   - You can do this with:
        
     ```sh
     touch ~/.Xmodmap
     ```
   - Then open the file using your favorite editor (let's say nano).
        
     ```sh
     nano ~/.Xmodmap
     ```
   - Each line in the xmodmap file follows the syntax “keycode KEYCODE = KEYSYMBOL”. To bind right arrow function to the right shift key, add a new line that looks like:
        
     ```sh
     keycode 62 = Right
     ```
     Here, 62 is the key code value for the right shift key. You should replace this with the value you obtained in step 1.
   - Save the changes and close the editor.

3. Load the new key bindings:

   - You can load it with this command:
        
     ```sh
     xmodmap ~/.Xmodmap
     ```
     The changes will take effect immediately.

   - To make the change permanent even after restart, add the above command to your startup applications. In KDE, you can add a new startup script in: Autostart (under System Settings) -> Script File.

Note: The right shift will no longer work as a shift key because we have mapped the right arrow function to it.

This kind of keybind modification depends on personal preference. If you find that you've lost something crucial by mapping over the right shift key, you might prefer to choose another less frequently used key instead.
