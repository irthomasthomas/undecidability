**Prompt:**
npm uninstall doesn't do anything. How else can I remove an app

**Response:**
If you're trying to remove a package you installed via npm (Node Package Manager), you would use the npm uninstall command. Make sure to prepend it with the correct library name.

For instance, if you want to uninstall Express.js, you'll use:

```
npm uninstall express
```

However, if npm uninstall isn't working:

1. Be sure youâ€™re in the directory where the project is located before running npm uninstall. Otherwise, npm wouldn't know which project's dependencies to modify. 

2. You might need administrative or superuser rights to modify the installed packages. On Unix-based systems (like Linux or macOS), use sudo: 
```
sudo npm uninstall [package-name]
```
On Windows, open the command prompt as an administrator.

If you're still unable to remove the package, you may want to manually delete it. Go into the node_modules directory inside your project's directory and delete the corresponding package.

Bear in mind that these instructions are for uninstalling packages installed via npm. If you want to remove a standalone app that wasn't installed through npm, you'll need to use a different method depending on your operating system(Windows, MacOS, Linux). Some of those methods are uninstalling from the "Add/Remove Programs" option in Windows, dragging the app to the Trash on a Mac, or using a package manager like dpkg, apt, or yum in many Linux distributions.
