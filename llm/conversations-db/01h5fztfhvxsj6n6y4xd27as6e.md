**Prompt:**
how to add to gitignore?

**Response:**
To add files or directories to the `.gitignore` file and have Git ignore them, follow these steps:

1. Open the `.gitignore` file in a text editor. If the file doesn't exist, create a new file named `.gitignore` at the root level of your repository.

2. In the `.gitignore` file, you can add patterns to specify which files or directories should be ignored. Each pattern should be on a new line.

   - To ignore a specific file, simply add the filename with its relative path from the root of the repository. For example: `myFile.txt`
   
   - To ignore all files with a specific extension, use the `*.extension` pattern. For example: `*.log` will ignore all `.log` files.
   
   - To ignore a directory, add its name with a trailing slash. For example: `myDirectory/`
   
   - You can also use wildcard characters. For example, to ignore all files ending with `.tmp`, you can use `*.tmp`

3. Save the changes to the `.gitignore` file.

4. After saving, the files or directories specified in the `.gitignore` file will be ignored by Git. They will not be tracked or included in Git operations.

Remember to commit and push the `.gitignore` file to make the changes effective on your remote repository as well.
