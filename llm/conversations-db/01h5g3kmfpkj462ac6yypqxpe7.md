**Prompt:**
reset git changes

**Response:**
To reset git changes and discard all local modifications to your last commit, you can use the following command:
```
git reset --hard HEAD
```
This command will reset your current branch to the commit specified by `HEAD`, discarding all changes made after that commit. Note that this operation is irreversible, so make sure you have a backup of any changes you want to keep.

If you only want to unstage changes and keep the modifications in your working directory, you can use:
```
git reset HEAD
```
This command will unstage any changes you've made since your last commit, but the modified files will still remain in your working directory.

Additionally, if you want to undo the last commit but keep the changes as unstaged modifications, you can use:
```
git reset HEAD~1
```
This command will reset your branch to the previous commit, effectively "undoing" the last commit while keeping the changes in your working directory.

In any of these cases, be cautious as the command will permanently discard any changes you've made.
