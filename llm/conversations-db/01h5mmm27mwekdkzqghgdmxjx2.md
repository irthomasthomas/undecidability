**Prompt:**
What options can I use after: qdbus org.kde.krunner /App org.kde.krunner.App.displaySingleRunner

**Response:**
The `org.kde.krunner /App org.kde.krunner.App.displaySingleRunner` command is used to display a single runner in KDE's KRunner application.

After this, you would need to specify the id of the runner you want to display. This ID is unique for each runner and depends on the runner plugin, you have installed.

Here are examples of some runner IDs you might use:

1. `baloosearch`: This runner allows you to use the KDE's file indexer and search tool, Baloo, to find files and folders.

2. `shell`: This runner lets you run shell commands directly from KRunner.

3. `webshortcuts`: It allows you to use your web shortcuts directly from KRunner.

Example usage:

```bash
qdbus org.kde.krunner /App org.kde.krunner.App.displaySingleRunner "shell"
```

The above command will open the KRunner dialog with the shell runner selected.  

Keep in mind that the available runners will depend on what's installed on your system. To get a list of all installed runners, you can use the following command:

```bash
qdbus org.kde.krunner /App org.kde.krunner.App.querySingleRunnerInputs ""
```

This command will return all runner IDs installed.
