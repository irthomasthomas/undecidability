**Prompt:**
switch kde activity from bash and python

**Response:**
KDE activities can only be switched within GUI (Graphical User Interface). The KActivities module provides a command to control KDE activities, but it does not allow to switch activities directly.

However, you can use `xdotool` or `wmctrl`, both are command-line utilities for X11 to emulate activity switching. Here's a bash script example that switches to a specific activity:

```bash
#!/bin/bash
activity_id="{Your-Activity-ID}"
qdbus org.kde.ActivityManager /ActivityManager/Activities SetCurrentActivity $activity_id
```
Replace `{Your-Activity-ID}` with your target activity ID which can be obtained by `qdbus org.kde.ActivityManager /ActivityManager/Activities CurrentActivity`.

To do this in Python, you could use the `subprocess` module to call this bash command:

```python
import subprocess

activity_id="{Your-Activity-ID}"
subprocess.call(["qdbus", "org.kde.ActivityManager", "/ActivityManager/Activities", "SetCurrentActivity", activity_id])
```

Remember to replace `{Your-Activity-ID}` with your target activity ID.

Please note, you would need to have `qdbus` installed for this to work.

Keep in mind that the change may not take effect immediately, as KDE activities are designed to be switched manually by the user from the GUI. Not every KDE application may respond correctly to this command.
