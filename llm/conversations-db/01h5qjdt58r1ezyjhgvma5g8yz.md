**Response:**
This script creates a bash function that creates a hash (an associative array in bash) using activity id and activity name using KDE's ActivityManager.

The `get_activity_name` function returns activity name from activity id using KDE's `qdbus` command. Similarly, `get_current_activity` function is used to return both current activity id and name.

The `make_activity_hash` function first gets the current activity id and name, then creates an associative array (hash), `activity_hash`, with activity id as key and activity name as the value. Finally, it iterates through the array and displays the id and corresponding name.

Please note that this script relies on qdbus and KDE's ActivityManager, and so will only work in a KDE (K Desktop Environment) configured system. If you're running a different Linux desktop environment or operating system, you'd need to adjust the commands accordingly.

Make sure to save the script in a proper location, give it executable permissions using `chmod +x scriptname` and run it with `./scriptname` in terminal.
