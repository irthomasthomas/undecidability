**Prompt:**
how do shells like zsh write the code that adds text to the console input, so that the user can immediately edit that and then submit it

**Response:**
Interactive shell environments like zsh, bash or any other command-line interface can modify or add text to the console input through a variety of means. The general mechanism is that the shell writes out a line of text to the standard output (screen), and then immediately reads text from the standard input (keyboard), allowing the user to edit and submit.

The Readline library, which is used in many shells, provides a set of functions for writing text to the output and then reading and editing it from the input. This library can handle things like cursor movements, backspace key, and history up/down commands.

Pseudo code that could represent how this works:

```
while true:
    write_output(prompt)
    line = read_input()
    result = evaluate(line)
    write_output(result)
```

Here, `prompt` would be something like `username@hostname:~$ `, `line` is what the user types into the shell after the prompt, `evaluate(line)` would be the shell executing the command(s), and `result` would be the output of those commands.

In addition to these, some shells also support "precommands" or "preexec" functions which work by first writing a command to the console and executing it immediately. 

For example, in `zsh` this can be accomplished by creating a `preexec()` function, named literally `preexec`, that takes an input command as argument. This function gets executed every time before a command gets executed.

A rudimental built-in example in zsh is the `print` command, which simply writes out text that can be edited before submitting it:


```zsh
print -z "ls -la"
```

This puts `ls -la` into the command line as if the user had typed it. After running this command, user can edit `ls -la` before hitting Enter to submit it. Any library or programmatic approach will follow a similar concept, using system calls or library functions to write output, read input, and evaluate it.
