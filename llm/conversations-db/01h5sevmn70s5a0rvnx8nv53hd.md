Installation
Install this tool using pip:
pip install llm
Or using Homebrew (much slower):

Detailed installation instructions.
Getting started
If you have an OpenAI API key you can get started using the OpenAI models right away.
As an alternative to OpenAI, you can install plugins to access models by other providers, including models that can be installed and run on your own device.
Save your OpenAI API key like this:
llm keys set openai
This will prompt you for your key like so:
llm keys set openai
Enter key: <paste here>

Now that you've saved a key you can run a prompt like this:
llm "Five cute names for a pet penguin"
1. Waddles
2. Pebbles
3. Bubbles
4. Flappy
5. Chilly

Read the usage instructions for more.
Using a system prompt
You can use the -s/--system option to set a system prompt, providing instructions for processing other input to the tool.
To describe how the code a file works, try this:
cat mycode.py | llm -s "Explain this code"
Help
For help, run:
llm --help

You can also use:
python -m llm --help
