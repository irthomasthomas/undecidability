**Prompt:**
what is $- in bash?

**Response:**
In Bash, the dollar sign followed by a hyphen ($-) is a special variable that represents the current set of options or flags supplied to the shell. It is commonly used in scripts to access and manipulate command-line options passed to the script.

For example, if you run a script named "script.sh" with the command `./script.sh -a -b -c`, the value of $- within the script will be "-abc", indicating that the script was invoked with the options "a", "b", and "c" enabled.

You can use this variable to check which options are set or to perform different actions based on the provided options.
