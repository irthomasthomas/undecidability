**Prompt:**
whats the differnce between: [ -t 0 ], [[ $- == *i* ]], and [ -z "$PS1" ]

**Response:**
The differences between the following expressions are:

1. `[ -t 0 ]`: This expression checks if file descriptor 0 (standard input) is associated with a terminal. It returns true if a terminal is available for input, meaning the command is being run interactively, and false otherwise.

2. `[[ $- == *i* ]]`: In this expression, `$-` refers to the current options set for the shell. The expression checks if the options include the letter 'i', meaning the shell is running in interactive mode. It returns true if the shell is running interactively and false otherwise. Note that `[[ ... ]]` is a compound command that provides additional capabilities compared to `[ ... ]` (e.g., pattern matching).

3. `[ -z "$PS1" ]`: This expression checks if the environment variable `$PS1` is empty (has a length of zero). `$PS1` typically stores the primary prompt string for an interactive shell session. Therefore, this expression returns true if the primary prompt is not configured, indicating a non-interactive shell session (e.g., a script running without user interaction).

In summary, the first expression checks if input is being provided interactively, the second expression detects if the shell session is interactive, and the third expression determines whether the shell is running interactively by checking if the primary prompt is set.
