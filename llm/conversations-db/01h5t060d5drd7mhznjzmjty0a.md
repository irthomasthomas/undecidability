**Prompt:**
How do I save the sidecar file when I export an image from darktable?

**Response:**
When exporting an image from darktable, the software automatically generates a sidecar file with the same name as the image, but different extension (.xmp). This file can be found in the same location as the exported image. 

However, you might want to make sure if you have the auto-generation of sidecar files enabled. To do this:

1. Open darktable.
2. Go to the “settings” menu.
3. Click on “preferences”.
4. From the tabs on the top, select the one labeled “storage”.
5. There, you should see an option “write sidecar files for each image”. 
6. Make sure it's marked “on”.

If this option is enabled, darktable will automatically generate sidecar files when you develop and export images. The sidecar files save all the changes you made to the original image, so you can reproduce or amend your work whenever you want without modifying the original file.
