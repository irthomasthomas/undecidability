**Response:**
```bash
#!/bin/bash

# Check if kdeconnect-cli exists
if ! command -v kdeconnect-cli &> /dev/null
then
    echo "KDE Connect CLI could not be found. Please install it first."
    exit
fi

# Check if jq is installed for JSON parsing
if ! command -v jq &> /dev/null
then
    echo "jq could not be found. Please install it first for JSON parsing."
    exit
fi

# Get the list of connected devices
DEVICES_JSON=$(kdeconnect-cli --list-available --id-only)
DEVICE_IDS=$(echo "${DEVICES_JSON}" | jq -r '.devices[].id')

# Function to send message
send_message() {
    local DEVICE_ID="$1"
    local MESSAGE="$2"
    kdeconnect-cli --device "${DEVICE_ID}" --send-sms --destination "<PHONE_NUMBER>" --message "${MESSAGE}"
}

# Check if input is provided, else exit with error
if [ -z "$1" ]; then
    echo "No input provided. Please provide the message as an argument."
else
    # Loop over all connected devices and send message
    for DEVICE_ID in ${DEVICE_IDS}; do
        send_message "${DEVICE_ID}" "$1"
    done
fi
```

Replace `<PHONE_NUMBER>` with the actual phone number. Providing this dynamically will require additional user input.
