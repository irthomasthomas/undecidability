**Prompt:**
Think it through carefully. Using Manjaro/Arch Linux,Kernel 6,KDE Plasma 5.2,QT5,Python 3.10. I have a list of commands that open GUI desktops apps. How can I automatically test that those works?

**Response:**
Automating GUI applications testing, especially in Linux, can be a bit tricky, but there are several tools and solutions available that you can implement.

Here's a general approach:

First, you need to install a tool or library that allows you to simulate user interaction with the GUI. Some libraries that allow you to do this are python-dogtail, LDTP (Linux Desktop Testing Project), SikuliX, or PyAutoGUI. These libraries can simulate clicks, typing, and other user interaction with the GUI.

Then, you'll write test scripts in Python to interact with the GUI as a user would. For example, boot the app, click on a particular button, etc. Each of these scripts can be a test case. You'd also need error handling in your script to log failures (e.g., app doesn't open, button doesn't exist).

Let's use `PyAutoGUI` for this example:

1. Install PyAutoGUI: 

    ```
    pip install PyAutoGUI
    ```

2. Write your test script:

    ```python
    import pyautogui
    import subprocess
    import time

    # list of commands to open the apps
    commands = ['command1', 'command2', 'command3']

    for command in commands:
        # start the app
        process = subprocess.Popen(command, shell=True)
        time.sleep(5)  # wait for the app to open
        # Check if application opened by checking if its window exists.
        if pyautogui.getWindow(command): 
            print(command + " opened successfully.")
            # Here you can interact with the app, for instance:
            # pyautogui.click(x=button_x_position, y=button_y_position)
            process.terminate()  # close the app after testing
        else:
            print(command + " failed to open.")
    ```
Remember you have to replace 'command1', 'command2', etc. with the actual commands used to launch your applications and also add the necessary checks and interactions in the script.

Additionally note that locations in `pyautogui.click()` (i.e., x and y coordinates) will have to be specific to your application's GUI layout.

Finally, you can run these scripts periodically or trigger them manually to test your GUI apps. Make sure your desktop environment is running and your DISPLAY environment variable is set correctly, so the scripts can interact with the desktop. An important point to remember is testing GUI applications can be subject to changes in GUI design or layout.
