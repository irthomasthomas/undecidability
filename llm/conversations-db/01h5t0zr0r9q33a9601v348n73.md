**Prompt:**
close windowpid with xdotool

**Response:**
In order to close a window using `xdotool`, you first need to determine the window ID of the window you want to close. You can do this by running the command `xdotool search <window name>`, where `<window name>` is the title or part of the title of the window you want to close.

Once you have the window ID, you can use the command `xdotool windowclose <window ID>` to close the window.

Here's an example:

1. Open the terminal.
2. Run the command `xdotool search "Firefox"`. This will give you the window ID of the Firefox window(s) if it is open.
3. Take note of the window ID that is returned (e.g., 12345678).
4. Run the command `xdotool windowclose 12345678` to close the Firefox window with the specified ID.

Note that the window ID can change each time the application is launched, so you may need to update the ID accordingly each time you run the command.
