**Prompt:**
write a dall-e prompt for ezekiels vision. Think it through carefully, first.

**Response:**
"Create an illustration inspired by Ezekiel's vision in the Bible. The image should contain a sky filled with stormy clouds, from which emanates dazzling light. In the center, envision four living creatures with human forms, each possessing four faces - a human face, a lion's face, an ox's face, and an eagle's face. Each creature should have four wings, with two covering their bodies and two making them fly. They should be standing upright on straight legs, with the soles of their feet resembling the shape of a calf's foot but gleaming like burnished bronze. In the midst of these figures, illustrate four flaming wheels that appear to be intersecting each other, glowing with color as if full of eyes. Above the heads of these creatures, imagine an expanse, sparkling like crystal, beneath what looks like a throne made of sapphire. Finally, sitting on this throne, depict a figure that bears a human likeness, yet cloaked in radiant light with a fiery glow, symbolizing the divine presence."
