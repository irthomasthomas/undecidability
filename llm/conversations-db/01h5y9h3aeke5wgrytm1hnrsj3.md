**Prompt:**
Think it through carefully. How did the custom of baptism come to be? What similar rituals exsist in other faiths? List a few bible quotes which have the strongest arument.

**Response:**
The custom of baptism originated from Judeo-Christian religious practices, becoming a sacrament or rite of initiation particularly for Christianity. It’s a visible symbol of an individual's admission into a Christian community. 

The practice was prominent in the life and ministry of John the Baptist, who is heralded in the Bible as baptizing people in the river Jordan as an act of repentance and preparation for the coming of Jesus Christ. The most significant mention of baptism in the Bible is the baptism of Jesus Christ himself, by John the Baptist.

Similar rituals exist in other religions:

1. Islam - "Ghusl" is a full-body ritual purification mandatory before the performance of various rituals and prayers, for adults, after sexual intercourse, and after completion of the menstrual cycle.

2. Sikhism - The "Amrit Sanskar" (also called Khande di Pahul) is a baptism ceremony that was introduced by Guru Gobind Singh when he founded the Khalsa in 1699.

3. Hinduism - The "Upanayana/Janeu Sanskar" ritual ceremony is an initiation ritual, also called sacred thread ceremony, that marks a boy's entrance into the first of the four Ashramas (stages of life). 

Strongest biblical references related to baptism:

1. Matthew 3:13-17, "Then Jesus came from Galilee to the Jordan to be baptized by John."
  
2. Mark 16:16, "Whoever believes and is baptized will be saved, but whoever does not believe will be condemned."

3. Acts 2:38, "Peter replied, 'Repent and be baptized, every one of you, in the name of Jesus Christ for the forgiveness of your sins. And you will receive the gift of the Holy Spirit’.”

4. Romans 6:3-4, "Or don't you know that all of us who were baptized into Christ Jesus were baptized into his death? We were therefore buried with him through baptism into death in order that, just as Christ was raised from the dead through the glory of the Father, we too may live a new life."

5. 1 Peter 3:21, "and this water symbolizes baptism that now saves you also—not the removal of dirt from the body but the pledge of a clear conscience towards God. It saves you by the resurrection of Jesus Christ."
