**Prompt:**
What is a reverse pomodoro?

**Response:**
The Reverse Pomodoro Technique is a time management method that is a reversal of the traditional Pomodoro Technique. Instead of dividing your time into "work intervals" followed by short breaks, in reverse Pomodoro you start with a break or leisure time, followed by longer periods of productive work. One example would be starting with 5 minutes of relaxation or preparation, then working for 25 minutes straight. This method can be particularly effective for those who struggle with starting tasks or projects.
