**Prompt:**
How do shell scripts handle the case when they need user input but they are not running interactively?

**Response:**
Shell scripts handle the case when they need user input but are not running interactively in a few ways. This includes providing default values, reading values from environment variables or configuration files, using command-line arguments, or reading input from a file. 

1. Default Values: If a script needs input but is not being run interactively (for example, if it's being run as a cron job), the script might be written to use a default value if no input is available.

2. Environment Variables: A script might read necessary input from environment variables, which are set in the shell before the script is run.

3. Configuration Files: The script could be designed to read its input from a configuration file. This method is often used for complex inputs.

4. Command-Line Arguments: Scripts can accept input as command-line arguments.

5. Input File: The input can be provided using a text file. The script can be programmed to read from this file.

But if a shell script needs interactive user input, it won't be able to run properly when scripted to run in a non-interactive mode unless it is properly set up to handle this situation.
