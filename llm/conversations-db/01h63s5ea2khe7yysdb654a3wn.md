**Prompt:**
How do shell scripts handle the case when they need user input but they are not running interactively?

**Response:**
Shell scripts handle such case by either of the following ways:

1. Default Values: If the script needs user input, it can be programmed to use default values in case there is no interactive input.

2. Input Arguments: Parameters or arguments can be passed to the shell script while running it. The script is written in a way to read these arguments as input.

3. Input File or Configuration File: Another common way is to have the script read from an input file or configuration file. This file would contain all the necessary inputs for the script.

4. Using Expect Scripts: An "expect" script can be written to automate the interactive input process. This is a more advanced method and can be used for more complex scenarios where inputs are dependent on certain conditions.

5. Environment Variables: Scripts can also be written to use environment variables as input. This can be useful when multiple scripts need the same inputs.

6. Here Documents: A here document is a type of redirection that tells the shell to read input from the current source (Here document) until a line containing only delimiter (with no trailing spaces) is seen. 

Example of a script using input arguments:

```bash
#!/bin/bash
echo "Hello, $1"
```

When this script is run with a parameter like `./script.sh World`, it will print "Hello, World".

**Prompt:**
What about using a GUI dialog box?

**Response:**
Yes, you can use a GUI dialog box for user input in shell scripts when running in a GUI environment, using utilities like `zenity`, `kdialog`, `xmessage`, or `yad`.

For instance, here's how you can use `zenity` in a bash script:

```bash
#!/bin/bash
NAME=$(zenity --entry --title="Login" --text="Enter your name:")
echo "Hello, $NAME"
```
When this script runs, a dialog box will pop up asking for your name which then echoes "Hello, $NAME", where $NAME is the value entered in the dialog box.

Please note that these utilities must be installed on your system to use them and they require a running X server, so it's not suitable for all environments especially without a GUI.

**Prompt:**
And dialog?

**Response:**
Sure, the `dialog` utility in Linux is used to create a pseudo-graphical interface in the shell, which can be very useful for scripting purposes.

The `dialog` utility lets you create dialog boxes such as yes/no boxes, input boxes, message boxes, text boxes, check lists, radio lists, file selectors, etc., as part of your command-line application.

Here is an example of how you might use it:

```bash
#!/bin/bash

NAME=$(dialog --inputbox "Enter your name:" 8 40 2>&1 >/dev/tty)

clear

echo "Hello, $NAME"
```

In this example, a dialog box will pop up in your terminal asking you to "Enter your name:". Once a name is entered and 'OK' is selected, the command `echo "Hello, $NAME"` will print out a greeting with the entered name.

Please note, you may need to install `dialog` on your system if it isn't already (you can do this with `sudo apt-get install dialog` on Debian-based systems, or `yum install dialog` on RHEL-based systems).

Remember, `dialog` works in a command-line environment, unlike utilities like `zenity` and `kdialog` which are designed for graphical environments.

**Prompt:**
Write a universal dialogbox function that checks which dialogbox utilities are available and uses the first one, in the order of: zenity, kdialog, xmessage, yad, dialog.

**Response:**
Here is a function in shell script that does the required:

```bash
#!/bin/bash

dialogbox() {
    local message=$1
    if command -v zenity >/dev/null; then
        zenity --info --text="$message"
    elif command -v kdialog >/dev/null; then
        kdialog --msgbox "$message"
    elif command -v xmessage >/dev/null; then
        xmessage "$message"
    elif command -v yad >/dev/null; then
        yad --text "$message"
    elif command -v dialog >/dev/null; then
        dialog --msgbox "$message" 10 40
    else
        echo "$message"
    fi
}

# Call the function with sample text
dialogbox "Hello, world!"
```

This function, `dialogbox`, takes one argument: the message to display. It checks for the existence of each of the dialog box utilities in turn, and uses the first available one to display the message. If none of the utilities are available, it simply echoes the message to the terminal.

The `command -v` command checks for command existence and is used here to detect the existence of the various dialog window utilities. The `/dev/null` discards the standard output of the command.
