**Prompt:**
simulate typing in terminal when using print -z

**Response:**
If you're inquiring about how to simulate keystrokes in terminal when using "print -z" in zsh, you can do this by typing:

```bash
print -z "your command here"
```

The "print -z" command in zsh puts "your command here" onto the command line as if you had typed it. 

For example, if you type:

```bash
print -z "ls"
```

Next time you hit Enter, "ls" will be executed. 

Note: This only works in Z shell (zsh), and not in other shells like Bash or Fish.
