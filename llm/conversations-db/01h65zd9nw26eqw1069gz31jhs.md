**Prompt:**
DO NOT USE MARKDOWN.
Reply only with the text of the bash script and nothing else. Use inline code comments if you need to say anything else.
Think it through step-by-step.
Requirements (If the line is blank after this, then the user input failed. Tell the user that they did not provide any input.): For each .desktop file in the path provided, launch each one and check to make sure it opened properly or errored. Log the result.
Additional Goals:
  - Minimise IF statements and branching.
  - Write intelligent, self-documenting code.
  - Minimise duplication. Minimise Verbosity.
  - Write code that is modern, clean and fast.

WARNING: Do not include a markdown code block.
Beware of bugs and tricky syntax. SAY NOTHING ELSE!


**Response:**
#!/bin/bash

# Check if the user provided a path
if [ -z "$1" ]; then
  echo "No path provided."
  exit 1
fi

# Loop through each .desktop file in the provided path
for file in "$1"/*.desktop; do
  # Launch the .desktop file
  if ! xdg-open "$file" &>/dev/null; then
    echo "Error opening $file"
  else
    echo "$file opened successfully"
  fi
done
