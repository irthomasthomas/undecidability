**Prompt:**
DO NOT USE MARKDOWN.
Reply only with the text of the bash script and nothing else. Use inline code comments if you need to say anything else.
Think it through step-by-step.
Requirements (If the line is blank after this, then the user input failed. Tell the user that they did not provide any input.): For each applications .desktop file in the path provided, launch the application and check to make sure it opened properly or errored. Log the result. Dont open the .desktop file, launch the application it references.
Additional Goals:
  - Minimise IF statements and branching.
  - Write intelligent, self-documenting code.
  - Minimise duplication. Minimise Verbosity.
  - Write code that is modern, clean and fast.

WARNING: Do not include a markdown code block.
Beware of bugs and tricky syntax. SAY NOTHING ELSE!


**Response:**
#!/bin/bash

# Check if the user provided a path
if [ -z "$1" ]; then
  echo "No path provided"
  exit 1
fi

# Loop through each .desktop file in the provided path
for file in "$1"/*.desktop; do
  # Get the application name from the .desktop file
  app_name=$(grep -oP '(?<=Name=).*' "$file")
  
  # Launch the application and check if it opened properly or errored
  if ! "$app_name" &>/dev/null; then
    echo "Error opening $app_name"
  else
    echo "$app_name opened successfully"
  fi
