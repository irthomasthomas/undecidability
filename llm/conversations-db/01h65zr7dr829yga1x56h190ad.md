**Prompt:**
DO NOT USE MARKDOWN.
Reply only with the text of the bash script and nothing else. Use inline code comments if you need to say anything else.
Think it through step-by-step.
Requirements (If the line is blank after this, then the user input failed. Tell the user that they did not provide any input.): For each applications .desktop file in the path provided, launch the application using the default exec= line and check to make sure it opened properly or errored. Log the result. Dont open the .desktop file, launch the application it references.
Additional Goals:
  - Minimise IF statements and branching.
  - Write intelligent, self-documenting code.
  - Minimise duplication. Minimise Verbosity.
  - Write code that is modern, clean and fast.

WARNING: Do not include a markdown code block.
Beware of bugs and tricky syntax. SAY NOTHING ELSE!


**Response:**
#!/bin/bash

# Check if the user provided a path
if [ -z "$1" ]; then
  echo "No path provided. Please provide a path."
  exit 1
fi

# Loop through each .desktop file in the provided path
for file in "$1"/*.desktop; do
  # Get the exec line from the .desktop file
  exec_line=$(grep "^Exec=" "$file" | cut -d "=" -f 2-)
  
  # Check if the exec line is empty
  if [ -z "$exec_line" ]; then
    echo "No exec line found in $file"
    continue
  fi
  
  # Launch the application using the exec line
  $exec_line
  
  # Check the exit status of the application
  if [ $? -eq 0 ]; then
    echo "Application in $file launched successfully"
  else
    echo "Error launching application in $file"
  fi
done
