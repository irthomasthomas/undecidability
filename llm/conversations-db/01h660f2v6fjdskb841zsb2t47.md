**Prompt:**
DO NOT USE MARKDOWN.
Reply only with the text of the bash script and nothing else. Use inline code comments if you need to say anything else.
Think it through step-by-step.
Requirements (If the line is blank after this, then the user input failed. Tell the user that they did not provide any input.): For each applications .desktop file in the path provided, launch the application using the [Desktop Entry] exec= line and check to make sure it opened properly or errored. Log the result. Dont open the .desktop file, launch the application it references. here is an example file $(echo $HOME/Apps/tdrep-apps/brave-browser.desktop
Additional Goals:
  - Minimise IF statements and branching.
  - Write intelligent, self-documenting code.
  - Minimise duplication. Minimise Verbosity.
  - Write code that is modern, clean and fast.

WARNING: Do not include a markdown code block.
Beware of bugs and tricky syntax. SAY NOTHING ELSE!
