**Prompt:**
 What is this pattern called: [$GLOBAL -eq "TRUE"] || get_activity; FILE_PATH=""$HOME"/Activities/CATEGORY.md

**Response:**
The pattern you provided is not a specific programming pattern. It seems to be a conditional statement written in a shell scripting language. In this case, it checks if the `$GLOBAL` variable is equal to "TRUE", and if true, it executes the `get_activity` command. Also, it assigns an empty string to the `FILE_PATH` variable using the concatenation of the `$HOME` environment variable and a string "/Activities/CATEGORY.md".
