**Prompt:**
 What is this pattern called: [$GLOBAL -eq "TRUE"] || get_activity; FILE_PATH=""$HOME"/Activities/CATEGORY.md

**Response:**
This pattern can be described as a combination of a conditional shell script statement and a file path in Unix. Specifically, it first checks if the value of the variable "GLOBAL" equals "TRUE". If not, it will execute the `get_activity` command. 

Then it sets the "FILE_PATH" variable to a markdown file located in the "Activities" directory of the current user's home directory with the "CATEGORY.md" file name. This can be typically seen in bash scripts.

However, this pattern doesn't have a specific, widely-accepted name as it's more like a combination of several concepts rather than a well-known design pattern.
