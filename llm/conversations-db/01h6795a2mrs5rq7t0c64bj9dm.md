**Prompt:**
 What is this pattern called: [$GLOBAL -eq "TRUE"] || get_activity

**Response:**
This pattern is called a Logical OR control operator in bash scripting. 

If the first condition [$GLOBAL -eq "TRUE"] is true, then the second statement get_activity will not be executed, because the overall condition has already met. If the first condition is false, then it will execute the get_activity. 

With Logical OR operator, if any one of the conditions is true, then the result will be true.

**Prompt:**
why are they better or worse than if branching?

**Response:**
The Logical OR (||) operator can be better when you have simple checks and you want to perform an action if a certain condition is false. It offers a concise format to express this concept, which can make code easier to read and write.

Advantages:
1. Code readability: Using || is often shorter and more concise than using if-else statements.
2. Execution speed: || can be faster than if-else because it stops checking as soon as it finds a true statement (Short-circuit evaluation).

Disadvantages:
1. Complexity: If your logic is complex, using || can make your code harder to understand and maintain compared to a well-structured if-else block.
2. Side Effects: The right-hand side of the || operator is only evaluated if the left-hand side is false. This can lead to unexpected behaviors if there are side effects.

If your code's logic is complex or you need to perform more actions based on the condition, using if-else branching is more appropriate. It offers more flexibility than || operator and can be more readable in complex conditions.
