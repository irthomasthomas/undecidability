**Prompt:**
ask for user confirmation in bash

**Response:**
To ask for user confirmation in bash, you can use the `read` command to get user input and the `echo` command to display the confirmation message. Here's an example:

```bash
echo "Are you sure you want to proceed? [y/n]"
read confirmation

if [ "$confirmation" == "y" ] || [ "$confirmation" == "Y" ]; then
    echo "Confirmed. Proceeding..."
    # continue with your code
else
    echo "Confirmation declined. Exiting..."
    exit 1  # exit with a non-zero status code
fi
```

In the above code, the user is prompted with the confirmation message, and their input is stored in the `confirmation` variable using the `read` command. Then, an `if` statement is used to check if the user's input matches the desired confirmation condition (e.g., "y" or "Y" for yes). If the condition is met, the code proceeds with the desired actions. Otherwise, the code exits with a non-zero status code (1 in this example).
