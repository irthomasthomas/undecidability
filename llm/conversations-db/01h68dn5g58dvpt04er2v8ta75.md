**Prompt:**
git pull $(paste)

**Response:**
If you want to pull changes from a remote repository using the `git pull` command, you need to specify the name of the remote repository and the branch you want to pull from.

The syntax for the `git pull` command is as follows:

```
git pull <remote> <branch>
```

So, you would replace `$(paste)` with the name of the remote repository and the branch you want to pull from. For example:

```
git pull origin master
```

This command will pull the latest changes from the `master` branch of the `origin` remote repository.
