**Prompt:**
git pull git commit -m

**Response:**
It looks like you have combined two separate commands, `git pull` and `git commit -m`.

`git pull` is used to fetch and merge changes from a remote repository into your local repository.

`git commit -m` is used to commit changes to your local repository with a descriptive message.

To use both commands together, you would typically follow these steps:

1. Make changes to your files in your local repository.
2. Use `git add` to stage your changes.
3. Use `git commit -m "commit message"` to commit your changes with a descriptive message.
4. Use `git pull` to fetch and merge any remote changes into your local repository.

Note that it's recommended to run `git pull` before `git commit` to ensure that you have the latest changes from the remote repository before committing your own changes.
