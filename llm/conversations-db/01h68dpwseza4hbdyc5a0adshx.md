**Prompt:**
git pull hint: You have divergent branches and need to specify how to reconcile them.
hint: You can do so by running one of the following commands sometime before
hint: your next pull:
hint: 
hint:   git config pull.rebase false  # merge
hint:   git config pull.rebase true   # rebase
hint:   git config pull.ff only       # fast-forward only
hint: 
hint: You can replace "git config" with "git config --global" to set a default
hint: preference for all repositories. You can also pass --rebase, --no-rebase,
hint: or --ff-only on the command line to override the configured default per
hint: invocation.
fatal: Need to specify how to reconcile divergent branches.

**Response:**
When running `git pull`, you encountered a situation where you have divergent branches, meaning that your local branch and the remote branch have diverged and cannot be automatically merged. 

To resolve this, you need to specify how to reconcile the divergent branches. Here are a few options you can choose from:

1. Merge: Run `git config pull.rebase false` to set the merge strategy. Then you can run `git pull` again to perform a merge between the divergent branches.

2. Rebase: Run `git config pull.rebase true` to set the rebase strategy. Then you can run `git pull` again to rebase your local branch onto the latest commits on the remote branch.

3. Fast-forward only: Run `git config pull.ff only` to set the fast-forward only strategy. Then you can run `git pull` again, which will only perform a fast-forward merge if possible. If a fast-forward merge is not possible due to the divergent branches, it will result in an error.

You can use these commands before your next `git pull`, or you can pass the `--rebase`, `--no-rebase`, or `--ff-only` flags directly to the `git pull` command to override the configured default on a per-invocation basis.

If you want to set a default preference for all repositories, you can use `git config --global` instead of `git config`.

Choose the strategy that suits your needs and specify it using one of the provided methods to resolve the error and successfully perform `git pull`.
