**Prompt:**
how to automatically update readme when adding new file and commit

**Response:**
To automatically update the `README.md` file when adding a new file and committing, you can use GitHub Actions or a pre-commit hook.

1. GitHub Actions:
   - Navigate to your repository on GitHub and click on the "Actions" tab.
   - Choose an existing workflow or create a new workflow file. For example, `.github/workflows/update-readme.yml`.
   - Define the workflow by providing a name, specifying the trigger, and defining the necessary steps.
   - Use appropriate GitHub Actions such as `actions/checkout` to fetch the code, `actions/commit` and `actions/checkout` to commit changes, and `actions/create-pull-request` to create a pull request.
   - Inside the workflow, you can run a script to automatically update the `README.md` file before committing. For instance, using a script like `sed`, you can replace placeholders or generate dynamic content in the `README.md` file.
   - Once the workflow is defined, commit and push the `.github/workflows/update-readme.yml` file to the repository. The workflow will then trigger whenever a commit is made.
   
2. Pre-commit hook:
   - If you prefer a local setup, you can use a pre-commit hook, which triggers a script on your local machine before each commit.
   - Inside your repository's root directory, open the `.git/hooks/` folder.
   - Create a new file called `pre-commit`. This file will be used as a shell script.
   - Add the necessary logic to update the `README.md` file. You could use a scripting language like Bash or Python to automate this process.
   - Make the script executable by running the command `chmod +x .git/hooks/pre-commit`.
   - From now on, whenever you commit changes, the `pre-commit` script will be executed, automatically updating the `README.md` file before the commit.

These instructions provide a starting point for automatically updating the `README.md` file when adding new files and committing changes. You can customize the logic and actions based on your specific requirements.
