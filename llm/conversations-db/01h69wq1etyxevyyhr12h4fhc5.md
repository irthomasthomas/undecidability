**Prompt:**
Explain Visual Regression

**Response:**
Visual regression refers to the process of comparing and analyzing visual differences between two or more versions of a website or application. It involves capturing screenshots or images of specific areas or pages of a website or application and comparing them pixel by pixel to identify any visual discrepancies or changes.

Visual regression testing is typically performed as part of the software testing process to ensure that any updates or changes made to a website or application do not result in unintended visual defects or alterations. It is especially useful for detecting visual regressions or anomalies that may not be easily identified through traditional functional or unit testing.

To conduct visual regression testing, developers or testers often use specialized tools or frameworks that automate the process of capturing screenshots of different versions of a website or application. These tools can compare the screenshots and highlight any differences, enabling users to identify and analyze visual changes in a more efficient and reliable manner.

The main goal of visual regression testing is to ensure that the user interface and overall visual appearance of a website or application remain consistent across different versions or updates. By detecting and addressing visual regressions early in the development process, organizations can maintain a high level of user experience and prevent negative impacts on their brand reputation.
