**Prompt:**
what would happen to e.g. ffmpeg recording when you pause the activity it runs in in kde

**Response:**
When you pause an activity in KDE, it means that the specific set of applications associated with that activity will be suspended. If you have an ffmpeg recording running within that activity, it will also be paused.

Pausing the activity will essentially freeze the state of all applications within it, including ffmpeg. This means that the recording will be temporarily halted, and no further progress will be made until you resume the activity.

Once you resume the activity in KDE, all the applications, including ffmpeg, will be unfrozen and continue from where they left off. Your ffmpeg recording will resume capturing the desired activity or content. However, it's worth noting that the paused duration will not be recorded, creating a discontinuity in the final recording output.
