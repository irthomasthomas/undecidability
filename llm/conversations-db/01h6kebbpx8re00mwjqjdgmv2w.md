**Prompt:**
Quickly, what is the exact bash command to list hidden windows?
Reply only with the exact command text and nothing else before or after.

**Response:**
There isn't a bash command to list hidden windows. This is because bash is a command-line interface, and does not manage graphical user interface elements such as windows.
