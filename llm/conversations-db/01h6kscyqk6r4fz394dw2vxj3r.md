**Prompt:**
how to make a soft boiled egg

**Response:**
1. Place your eggs in a single layer at the bottom of a saucepan or pot. If you're cooking more than one egg, make sure they have enough room and are not touching each other.

2. Add enough water to the pot to cover the eggs completely, by at least an inch or two. 

3. Slowly heat the pot on a medium-high until it reaches a rolling boil.

4. Once the water is boiling, reduce the heat to low and let eggs cook for 4-5 minutes. 

5. While the eggs are boiling, prepare an ice water bath in a large bowl.

6. Use a slotted spoon or tongs to carefully remove the eggs from the pot and place them immediately into the chilled water to cool for at least 5 minutes.

7. Once the eggs have cooled, you can peel them. The easiest way to peel a soft-boiled egg is to tap it lightly until you see a crack, then peel away the shell gently. 

8. Enjoy your eggs whole or cut them open to reveal the beautifully soft, gooey yolk! 

Remember, soft boiled eggs can be a bit tricky and may require a bit of practice before you get the timing and technique just right. Don't be discouraged if your first few attempts aren't perfect.
