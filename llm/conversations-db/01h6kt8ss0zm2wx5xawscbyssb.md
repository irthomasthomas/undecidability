how to make a soft boiled egg

**Response:**
To make a soft boiled egg, follow these simple steps:

1. Place the desired number of eggs in a small saucepan.
2. Add enough cold water to the saucepan to cover the eggs by about an inch.
3. Place the saucepan on the stovetop over medium heat.
4. Once the water starts boiling, reduce the heat to low.
5. Set a timer for 4-5 minutes, depending on how runny you want the yolk to be.
6. While the eggs are cooking, prepare a bowl filled with cold water and ice.
7. Once the timer goes off, carefully transfer the eggs from the saucepan to the bowl of ice water using a slotted spoon.
8. Let the eggs sit in the ice water for about a minute to stop the cooking process.
9. Gently tap the eggs on a hard surface to crack the shell all around.
10. Peel the shell off, starting from the cracked end.
11. Serve immediately and enjoy your soft boiled eggs.

Note: The cooking time mentioned here is for large eggs and may vary depending on the size of the eggs and personal preference. Adjust the cooking time accordingly.
