**Prompt:**
how do I run a .desktop shortcut to an app?


**Response:**
To run a .desktop shortcut to an app in KDE Plasma on Manjaro, follow these steps:

1. Locate the .desktop file for the app. Usually, these files can be found in either `/usr/share/applications` or `~/.local/share/applications`. If you're unsure, you can use the `find` command to search for it.

2. Once you've found the .desktop file, right-click on it and select "Open with" > "Other Application" from the context menu.

3. In the "Open With" dialog, select "Run" and click "OK".

This will execute the .desktop shortcut and launch the corresponding application. If you face any issues or need more details, please let me know.
