**Prompt:**
how do I run a .desktop shortcut to an app?


**Response:**
To run a .desktop shortcut to an app in KDE Plasma on Manjaro, you can follow these steps:

1. Locate the .desktop file for the app. Usually, these files are stored in the `/usr/share/applications/` directory or the `~/.local/share/applications/` directory.

2. Once you have found the .desktop file, you can simply double-click on it to run the associated app.

Alternatively, you can also right-click on the .desktop file and select "Open with" and choose the application you want to use to run the file.
