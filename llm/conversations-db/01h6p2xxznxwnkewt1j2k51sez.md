**Prompt:**
how do I run a .desktop for an app using a shell?


**Response:**
To run a .desktop file for an application using a shell, you can use the `xdg-open` command followed by the path to the .desktop file. Here's an example:

```
xdg-open /path/to/your/application.desktop
```

This command will open the application associated with the .desktop file using the default handler. If the application is not installed or the .desktop file is not properly configured, it may not work as expected.

Let me know if you need more information or assistance with this.

**Prompt:**
that opens in a text editor

**Response:**
Apologies for the confusion. To execute a .desktop file and run the associated application, you can use the `kstart` command followed by the program name specified in the .desktop file.

Here's an example:

```
kstart /usr/bin/firefox
```

Replace `/usr/bin/firefox` with the actual command or path mentioned in the .desktop file for the application you want to run.

If you don't know the exact command, you can find it by opening the .desktop file with a text editor and looking for the `Exec` line. It should specify the command to run the application.

Let me know if you need further clarification or assistance with this.
