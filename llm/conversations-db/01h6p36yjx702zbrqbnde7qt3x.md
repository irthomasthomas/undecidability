**Prompt:**
how do I run a .desktop shortcut for an app using a shell?


**Response:**
To run a .desktop shortcut for an app using a shell, you can use the `xdg-open` command followed by the path to the .desktop file. Here's an example:

```
xdg-open /path/to/your/app.desktop
```

This command will open the application associated with the .desktop file. If the application is not already running, it will be launched.

Let me know if you need more details or assistance with anything else.

**Prompt:**
I want the application that the .desktop file points to open, I dont want to edit the file

**Response:**
Apologies for any confusion. In that case, you can use the `kstart` command to open the application associated with a .desktop file without directly editing the file itself. Here's an example:

```
kstart --desktop <desktop-file-name>.desktop <application>
```

Replace `<desktop-file-name>.desktop` with the name of your .desktop file (excluding the extension), and `<application>` with the actual executable name of the application.

For instance, if you have a .desktop file named `myapp.desktop` that points to an application called `myapp`, you would use the following command:

```
kstart --desktop myapp.desktop myapp
```

The `kstart` command will open the application without modifying the .desktop file. Let me know if you have any further questions or require additional assistance.
