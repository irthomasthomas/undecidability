**Prompt:**
How do I open an app using it's .desktop file in a shell?


**Response:**
To open an application using its .desktop file in a shell, you can use the `xdg-open` command followed by the path to the .desktop file. Here's an example:

```
xdg-open /path/to/application.desktop
```

Replace `/path/to/application.desktop` with the actual path to the .desktop file of the application you want to open.

Note that the `xdg-open` command is a utility provided by the xdg-utils package, which is commonly installed on most Linux distributions, including Manjaro. If you don't have it installed, you can install it using your package manager.
