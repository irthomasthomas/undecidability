**Prompt:**
How do I launch an app using the info in it's .desktop file from a shell?


**Response:**
To launch an application using the information in its .desktop file from a shell, you can use the `xdg-open` command followed by the path to the .desktop file. Here's an example:

```
xdg-open /path/to/application.desktop
```

This command will open the application specified in the .desktop file using the default application associated with its MIME type. If the .desktop file contains an executable path, it will be executed.
