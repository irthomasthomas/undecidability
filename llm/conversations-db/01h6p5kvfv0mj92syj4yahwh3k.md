**Prompt:**
How do I launch an application by using the info in it's .desktop file from a shell?


**Response:**
To launch an application using the information in its .desktop file from a shell, you can use the `xdg-open` command followed by the path to the .desktop file. Here's an example:

```
xdg-open /path/to/application.desktop
```

Replace `/path/to/application.desktop` with the actual path to the .desktop file of the application you want to launch.

The `xdg-open` command is a utility provided by the xdg-utils package, which is commonly installed on most Linux distributions, including Manjaro. It will open the specified file or URL using the default application associated with it.

If the .desktop file contains an Exec key, which specifies the command to run, `xdg-open` will execute that command and launch the application.

Remember to replace `/path/to/application.desktop` with the actual path to the .desktop file of the application you want to launch.
