**Prompt:**
How do I launch an application by using the info in it's .desktop file from a shell?


**Response:**
To launch an application using the information from its .desktop file, you can use the `xdg-open` command followed by the path to the .desktop file. Here's an example:

```
xdg-open /path/to/application.desktop
```

This command will open the application specified in the .desktop file using the default handler for that file type.
