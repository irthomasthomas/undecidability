**Prompt:**
How do I launch an application by using the info in it's .desktop file from a shell? I don't want to open the .desktop file using xdg-open or similar, I want to open the target


**Response:**
To launch an application using the information in its .desktop file from a shell, you can use the `Exec` field in the .desktop file. The `Exec` field specifies the command to be executed when launching the application.

Here's an example of how you can launch an application using its .desktop file:

1. Open a terminal.
2. Navigate to the directory where the .desktop file is located. For example, if the .desktop file is located in the `/usr/share/applications` directory, you can use the following command:

   ```
   cd /usr/share/applications
   ```

3. Use the `grep` command to find the .desktop file for the application you want to launch. For example, if you want to launch the Firefox browser, you can use the following command:

   ```
   grep -iRl "firefox" .
   ```

   This will search for the .desktop file containing the word "firefox" in the current directory and its subdirectories.

4. Once you have identified the .desktop file, open it using a text editor to view its contents. Look for the `Exec` field, which specifies the command to be executed.

5. Copy the command specified in the `Exec` field.

6. Return to the terminal and paste the command to launch the application. For example, if the `Exec` field contains `firefox %u`, you can use the following command to launch Firefox:

   ```
   firefox %u
   ```

   Replace `firefox` with the actual command from the .desktop file.

Please note that some .desktop files may contain additional placeholders or options that need to be replaced or modified. Make sure to review the contents of the .desktop file and adjust the command accordingly.
