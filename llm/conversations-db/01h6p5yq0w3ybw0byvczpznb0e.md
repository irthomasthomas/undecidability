**Prompt:**
How do I open the target of a .desktop app shortcut? from a bash script


**Response:**
To open the target of a .desktop app shortcut from a bash script, you can use the `grep` and `sed` commands to extract the `Exec` line from the .desktop file and then execute it. Here's an example script:

```bash
#!/bin/bash

desktop_file="/path/to/shortcut.desktop"

# Extract the Exec line from the .desktop file
exec_line=$(grep "^Exec=" "$desktop_file" | sed 's/^Exec=//')

# Execute the target of the .desktop file
eval "$exec_line"
```

Replace `/path/to/shortcut.desktop` with the actual path to your .desktop file. This script will extract the `Exec` line from the file and execute it using `eval`.

Please note that the `eval` command can be risky if the contents of the `Exec` line are not controlled or trustworthy. Make sure to use it only with trusted .desktop files.

Remember, you can ask for more details if needed.
