**Prompt:**
I want the application that the .desktop file points to open, I dont want to edit the file

**Response:**
To open the application that a .desktop file points to without editing the file directly, you can follow these steps:

1. Locate the .desktop file in your file manager. Usually, these files are stored in one of the following locations:
   - `/usr/share/applications/` (system-wide applications)
   - `~/.local/share/applications/` (user-specific applications)

2. Right-click on the .desktop file and select "Properties" or "Open With" from the context menu. If you choose "Properties," it will show you the file details. If you choose "Open With," you can select a text editor to open the file.

3. In the file properties or the text editor window, you should see a "Exec" line. This line contains the command that launches the application. However, editing the file is not necessary at this point.

4. Copy the command specified in the "Exec" line.

5. Open a terminal or press `Ctrl+Alt+T` to launch the terminal.

6. In the terminal, paste the copied command and press Enter. This command will run the application.

This method allows you to open the application without modifying or editing the .desktop file directly.
