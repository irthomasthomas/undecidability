**Prompt:**
I want the application that the .desktop file points to open, I dont want to edit the file

**Response:**
If you want to open the application that a `.desktop` file points to without manually editing the file, there are a few options:

1. Double-click: Double-clicking on the `.desktop` file should automatically open the application associated with it.

2. Terminal command: Open a terminal and use the `xdg-open` command followed by the path to the `.desktop` file. It will automatically open the associated application. For example:
   ```
   xdg-open path/to/application.desktop
   ```

3. Application launcher: Use the application launcher or menu in your desktop environment to search for the application mentioned in the `.desktop` file and launch it from there.

These methods ensure that you can open the application without modifying the `.desktop` file directly.
