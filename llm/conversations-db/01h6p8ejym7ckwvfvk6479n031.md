**Prompt:**
I want the application that the .desktop file points to open, I dont want to edit the file

**Response:**
If you want to open the application that a .desktop file points to without editing the file, you can directly execute the .desktop file. Here's how you can do it:

1. Open the terminal application on your computer (Ctrl+Alt+T on most Linux distributions).
2. Navigate to the directory where the .desktop file is located. For example, if the .desktop file is on the desktop, you can use the following command:

```
cd ~/Desktop
```

3. Use the following command to execute the .desktop file:

```
./filename.desktop
```

Replace "filename.desktop" with the actual name of the .desktop file you want to open. Make sure you include the .desktop extension.

4. Press Enter to execute the command.
   The application associated with the .desktop file should now open.

Note: In some cases, you might need to make the .desktop file executable before being able to execute it using the above method. You can make it executable by running the following command:

```
chmod +x filename.desktop
```

Remember to replace "filename.desktop" with the actual name of the .desktop file.
