**Prompt:**
How do I open the target of a .desktop app shortcut? from a bash script


**Response:**
You can use the `grep` command to extract the `Exec` line from the .desktop file, then use the `cut` command to retrieve the target application. Here's an example script:

```bash
#!/bin/bash

desktop_file="path/to/myapp.desktop"

# Extract the Exec line from the .desktop file
exec_line=$(grep "^Exec=" "$desktop_file")

# Remove the "Exec=" prefix
exec_line=${exec_line#Exec=}

# Extract the target application
app=$(echo "$exec_line" | cut -d" " -f1)

# Open the target application
"$app"
```

Replace "path/to/myapp.desktop" with the actual path to your .desktop file. Make sure the script is executable (`chmod +x script.sh`), and then you can run it from the terminal. Keep in mind that the target application must be in your system's PATH or you need to provide the full path to it.
