**Prompt:**
How do I open the target of a .desktop app shortcut? from a bash script

**Response:**
To open the target of a .desktop app shortcut from a bash script, you can use the `grep` command to extract the target executable path from the .desktop file, and then use the `xdg-open` command to open it.

Here's an example script that opens the target of a .desktop app shortcut:

```bash
#!/bin/bash

# Specify the path to the .desktop file
desktop_file="/path/to/your/app.desktop"

# Extract the target executable path from the .desktop file using grep
target_exec=$(grep -oP '(?<=Exec=).*' "$desktop_file" | head -n 1)

# Open the target using xdg-open
xdg-open "$target_exec"
```

Make sure to replace "/path/to/your/app.desktop" with the actual path to your .desktop file.

This script uses `grep` with a regex pattern to extract the "Exec" line from the .desktop file, and then uses `head -n 1` to select the first line (in case there are multiple "Exec" lines).

Finally, it passes the target executable path to `xdg-open` to open it. The `xdg-open` command is a standard command-line tool to open files, URLs, or applications based on the user's preferred applications.
