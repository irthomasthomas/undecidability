**Prompt:**
In manjaro/arch, add a new user, and copy the permission from an old user

**Response:**
To add a new user in Manjaro/Arch and copy the permissions from an old user, you can follow these steps:

1. Open a terminal.

2. Switch to the root user by running the following command and providing your password:
```bash
su -
```
3. Create a new user using the `useradd` command. Replace `newuser` with the desired username:
```bash
useradd -m newuser
```
4. Set a password for the new user by running the `passwd` command:
```bash
passwd newuser
```
Follow the prompts and enter the password twice.

5. Add the new user to the `wheel` group to grant administrative privileges:
```bash
usermod -aG wheel newuser
```

6. Copy the permissions from the old user to the new user. Run the following command while replacing `olduser` with the username of the old user and `newuser` with the username of the new user:
```bash
cp -a /home/olduser/. /home/newuser/
```
This recursively copies all files and directories from the old user's home directory to the new user's home directory, preserving ownership and permissions.

7. Change the ownership of the new user's home directory to the new user by executing the following command:
```bash
chown -R newuser:newuser /home/newuser
```

8. Optionally, you can change the shell for the new user by running:
```bash
chsh -s /bin/bash newuser
```
Replace `/bin/bash` with the desired shell (e.g., `/bin/zsh`).

Now you have successfully added a new user in Manjaro/Arch and copied the permissions from an old user.

**Prompt:**
Can I exclude certain dirs when running cp -a /home/olduser/. /home/newuser/

**Response:**
Yes, you can exclude certain directories when running the `cp` command with the `-a` option. To exclude specific directories, you can use the `--exclude` flag followed by the directory name.

Here's an example of how you can exclude certain directories while copying the permissions from the old user's home directory to the new user's home directory:

```bash
cp -a --exclude=directory1 --exclude=directory2 /home/olduser/. /home/newuser/
```

Replace `directory1` and `directory2` with the names of the directories you want to exclude. If there are more directories to exclude, you can add more `--exclude` flags accordingly.

By using the `--exclude` flag, the `cp` command will skip copying the specified directories while copying all other files and directories with their respective permissions from the old user's home directory to the new user's home directory.
