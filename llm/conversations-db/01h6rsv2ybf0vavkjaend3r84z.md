**Prompt:**
In manjaro/arch, add a new user, and copy the permission from an old user

**Response:**
You can create a new user and copy permissions from an existing user in Manjaro/Arch Linux by the following steps: 

1. First, you need to find out the groups of the old user.

```bash
    groups old_username
```

The above command will display the groups that the old user belongs to.

2. To create a new user:

```bash
    sudo useradd -m new_username
```

`-m` flag is used to create a home directory for the user.

3. Now to set a password for this user: 

```bash
    sudo passwd new_username
```

4. Now, you want to add the new user to the same groups as the old user. For this, use the `usermod` command:

```bash
    sudo usermod -a -G comma,separated,group,names new_username
```

5. Lastly, copy the contents from the old home directory to new home directory.

```bash
    sudo cp -r /home/old_username/* /home/new_username/
```

Remember to replace `old_username` and `new_username` with the correct usernames. 

6. You might need to change the owner of the newly copied files to the new user.

```bash
    sudo chown -R new_username:new_username /home/new_username/
```

Thatâ€™s it, you have successfully created a new user and copied the permissions from an old user in Manjaro/Arch Linux.

**Prompt:**
any way to exclude certain big dirs from the cp?

**Response:**
If you would like to exclude specific directories when copying files from the old user to the new user, you can use the `rsync` command.

Here's how you can use `rsync` to copy files and exclude certain directories.

```bash
sudo rsync -aP --exclude=/path/to/excluded/directory/ /home/old_username/ /home/new_username/
```

The `-a` option is for archive mode, which ensures that symbolic links, devices, permissions, ownership, modification times, ACLs, and any other filesystem properties and attributes are preserved.

The `-P` option combines the effects of `--progress` and `--partial`: it shows a progress bar during transfer and allows resuming of interrupted transfers.

The `--exclude` option excludes files that match the given pattern. 

Remember that the excluded directory path should be relative to the source directory.

After file transferring, remember to change the owner of the newly copied files to the new user:

```bash
sudo chown -R new_username:new_username /home/new_username/
```

Replace `/path/to/excluded/directory/`, `old_username`, and `new_username` with your real path and usernames. Note that you can use multiple `--exclude` options if you have more directories to exclude.
