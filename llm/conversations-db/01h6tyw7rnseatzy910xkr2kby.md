**Prompt:**
Explain sudo setfacl -R -m u:newuser:rwx /home/olduser

**Response:**
The command `sudo setfacl -R -m u:newuser:rwx /home/olduser` is used to modify Access Control Lists (ACLs) in Linux. 

Here's a breakdown of each part:

- `sudo`: This is to run the command as a superuser or root, which is required for modifying file and directory permissions.

- `setfacl`: This stands for "set file access control lists". It's a command to set the access control lists of a file or directory.

- `-R`: This is a flag that tells setfacl to operate recursively, modifying permissions for the specified directory and all of its contents.

- `-m`: This flag stands for "modify", indicating you want to change the current ACL.

- `u:newuser:rwx`: This section breaks down as follows: 
    - `u:` means you're changing permissions for a user.
    - `newuser` is the name of the user for whom you're changing permissions.
    - `rwx` sets the permissions you're granting, which stand for "read", "write", and "execute" respectively.

- `/home/olduser`: This is the directory for which you're changing permissions.

So in short, the command is telling the system to recursively modify the access control list for the /home/olduser directory, giving the user named newuser read, write, and execute permissions.
