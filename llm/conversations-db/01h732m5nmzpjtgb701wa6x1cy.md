**Prompt:**
think it through carefully. Give me a very short history of sea level measurements

**Response:**
Sea level measurements have been recorded for centuries, but systematic and accurate measurements began in the late 19th century. In 1885, the first permanent tide gauge was installed in Liverpool, England, providing continuous measurements of sea level. Over time, more tide gauges were established worldwide, allowing for global comparisons. In the 20th century, advancements in technology led to the development of satellite altimetry, which provided precise measurements of sea level from space. Today, a combination of tide gauges and satellite data is used to monitor and study sea level changes, providing valuable insights into the impacts of climate change.
