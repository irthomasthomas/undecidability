**Prompt:**
Tell me the history of sea level measurement. From the tide gauge at Liverpool to satellite altimetry. Include actual measurment tables for the best observed regions. Think it through carefully. 

**Response:**
Sea level measurement has a long history, dating back to the 19th century. The first systematic and continuous measurement of sea level was made in 1831 at the Liverpool Tidal Observatory in the UK. The observatory was established by William Hutchinson and used a stilling well, a device that allows water to enter and exit while minimizing the effects of waves, to measure the sea level. The measurements were recorded on a paper chart, which was replaced every 24 hours.

In the late 19th and early 20th centuries, tide gauges became more common. These devices, which are still used today, measure the height of the sea surface relative to a fixed point on land. They can be simple, consisting of a float in a stilling well connected to a recording device, or more complex, using radar or pressure sensors to measure the sea level.

In the mid-20th century, sea level measurements began to be made from ships using echo sounders. These devices send a sound pulse down to the sea floor and measure the time it takes for the echo to return, which gives the depth of the water. However, these measurements are not as accurate as those from tide gauges or satellites, as they are affected by variations in the speed of sound through water.

The advent of satellite altimetry in the late 20th century revolutionized sea level measurement. Satellites can measure the height of the sea surface over the entire globe, with a high degree of accuracy. The first satellite altimeter, Seasat, was launched by NASA in 1978. Since then, a series of satellites, including the TOPEX/Poseidon and Jason series, have provided continuous sea level measurements.

Satellite altimetry measures the time it takes for a radar pulse to travel from the satellite to the sea surface and back again. This gives the height of the sea surface relative to a reference ellipsoid that approximates the shape of the Earth. To convert this to sea level, corrections are made for factors such as the tide, atmospheric pressure, and the height of the satellite above the ellipsoid.

As for actual measurement tables, it's not feasible to provide them here due to the vast amount of data involved. However, the Permanent Service for Mean Sea Level (PSMSL) maintains a global database of monthly and annual mean sea level data from tide gauges. For satellite data, the AVISO+ service provides global sea level anomaly maps and time series.

In terms of the best observed regions, these tend to be in the North Atlantic and North Pacific, where there is a high density of tide gauges and satellite coverage. For example, the North Sea has been well observed due to its importance for shipping and its vulnerability to sea level rise. The PSMSL database includes long-term records from tide gauges in locations such as Brest (France), Newlyn (UK), and Cuxhaven (Germany). Satellite data provides good coverage of the global ocean, but is less accurate near the coast.

**Prompt:**
Give me a summary of tide level changes measured in liverpool

**Response:**
Tide gauge measurements at Liverpool's Bidston Observatory have been providing some of the longest scientific records of sea level, dating back to the 19th century (1831). 

The statistics show an average rise in mean sea levels of about 1.1 mm per year throughout the 20th century. When adjusted for land movement, the sea levels have been rising by around 1.4mm per year. 

However, a comprehensive analysis using the longest-running tide gauge records globally, including that of Liverpool, indicates that there has been a significant increase in the rate of sea level rise over the last 150 years.

In the specific case of Liverpool, a significant influence on sea level records is the post-glacial rebound. The land in the North West of England is gradually sinking because it's still responding to the removal of the weight of ice-age glaciers. This makes it look like the sea level is rising faster than in other areas.

Therefore, assessing tide level changes is a complex task that involves not just assessing global sea levels, but also interpreting these changes based on location-specific geological and climatic features.

For the exact numerical values and statistical detail, I would recommend referring to the data from the Permanent Service for Mean Sea Level (PSMSL) or the British Oceanographic Data Centre for Liverpool's recorded sea level measurements.
