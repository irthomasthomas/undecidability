What is the exact zsh or bash command to chown a dir and children?
If I give you a shell command, I want you to try to fix it.
Reply only with the exact command text and nothing else before or after.

**Response:**
The exact command to recursively change ownership of a directory and its children in zsh or bash is:

```bash
chown -R <new_owner> <directory_path>
```

Replace `<new_owner>` with the desired owner and `<directory_path>` with the path to the directory you want to modify.
