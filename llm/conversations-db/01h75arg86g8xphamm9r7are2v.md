**Prompt:**
Think it through carefuly, methodically and queitly.
What is the exact zsh or bash command to chown a dir and children?
If I give you a shell command, I want you to try to fix it.
Reply only with the exact command text and nothing else before or after.

**Response:**
The exact command to recursively change ownership of a directory and its children in zsh or bash is:

```bash
chown -R <user>:<group> <directory>
```

Replace `<user>` with the desired username and `<group>` with the desired group name. Also, replace `<directory>` with the path to the directory you want to change ownership for.

If you provide a shell command that needs fixing, please provide it so that I can assist you further.
