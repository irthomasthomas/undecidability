**Prompt:**
Think it through carefuly, methodically and queitly.

    What is the exact zsh or bash command to: chown a dir and children?

If I give you a shell command, I want you to try to fix it.


**Response:**
The exact command to recursively change ownership of a directory and its children in zsh or bash is:

```
chown -R <new_owner> <directory_path>
```

Replace `<new_owner>` with the desired owner and `<directory_path>` with the path to the directory.
