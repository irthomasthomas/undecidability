**Prompt:**
chown -R <user>:<group> <directory> or chown -R dir

**Response:**
The command "chown -R <user>:<group> <directory>" is used to change the ownership of a directory and its contents recursively. 

Here, "<user>" represents the new owner of the directory, "<group>" represents the new group ownership, and "<directory>" represents the directory whose ownership needs to be changed.

For example, if you want to change the ownership of the directory "mydir" to the user "john" and the group "users", you would use the following command:

chown -R john:users mydir

Alternatively, you can use the shorthand command "chown -R <user> <directory>" to change the ownership of a directory without specifying the group. For example:

chown -R john mydir

Both commands will recursively change the ownership of the directory and all its contents.
