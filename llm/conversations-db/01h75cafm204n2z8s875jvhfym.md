**Prompt:**
What is the exact zsh or bash command to: chown dir and children? If I give you a shell command, I want you to try to fix it.

**Response:**
To recursively change the ownership of a directory and its children, you can use the `chown` command with the `-R` option. Here's the command:

```bash
chown -R new_owner: new_group directory_path
```

Replace `new_owner` with the desired owner username or UID, `new_group` with the desired group name or GID, and `directory_path` with the path to the directory you want to change ownership for.
