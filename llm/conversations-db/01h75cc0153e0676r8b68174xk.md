**Prompt:**
Think it through carefuly. What is the exact zsh or bash command to: chown dir and children? If I give you a shell command, I want you to try to fix it.

**Response:**
To recursively change the ownership of a directory and its children, you can use the `chown` command with the `-R` option. Here's the command:

```bash
chown -R <user>:<group> <directory>
```

Replace `<user>` with the desired username or UID, `<group>` with the desired group name or GID, and `<directory>` with the path to the directory you want to change ownership for.
