**Prompt:**
do mkv files need to be finished?

**Response:**
No, MKV files do not necessarily need to be "finished" in order to be playable or usable. MKV (Matroska Video) is a file format that can contain various audio, video, and subtitle streams. As long as an MKV file has been properly encoded and contains the required streams, it should be playable. However, if a specific MKV file is incomplete or corrupted, it may not play or may have missing parts.
