**Prompt:**
do mp4 files from ffmpeg need to be finished?

**Response:**
No, mp4 files created using FFmpeg do not need to be explicitly finished. Once the FFmpeg command completes the encoding process and creates the mp4 file, it is considered finished and can be used or distributed as needed. It is not necessary to perform any additional steps to "finish" the mp4 file beyond what FFmpeg does during the encoding process.
