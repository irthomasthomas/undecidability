**Prompt:**
do mp4 files from ffmpeg need to be finished? what happens if I cancel the ffmpeg process?

**Response:**
No, MP4 files created using FFmpeg do not need to be "finished" in the typical sense. FFmpeg typically writes the output file progressively, so cancelling the process will result in an incomplete or partially written MP4 file.

When you cancel the FFmpeg process, the output file will still exist, but it may be truncated or missing some essential data. This can make the file unplayable or cause playback issues. It is generally recommended to let FFmpeg finish writing the output file before cancelling the process to ensure a complete and usable MP4 file.
