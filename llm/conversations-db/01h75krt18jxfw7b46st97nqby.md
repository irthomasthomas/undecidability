**Prompt:**
do mkv files from ffmpeg need to be finished? what happens if I cancel the ffmpeg process?

**Response:**
MKV files created by FFmpeg do not necessarily need to be "finished" to be playable or usable. FFmpeg writes data to the output file in chunks, which means the partially processed file can still be played or analyzed. 

If the FFmpeg process is canceled abruptly or terminated, the MKV file will still exist, but it might be incomplete or corrupted. Playback of the partially written file may not be possible or result in unexpected behavior, depending on how much data has been written.

To ensure the file is usable, it is recommended to allow FFmpeg to complete the encoding process or use appropriate flags to ensure it is properly finalized. This can help avoid any potential issues with the resulting output file.
