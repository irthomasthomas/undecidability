**Prompt:**
I use ffmpeg to record my linux screen. How should I tell fmpeg to stop recording?

**Response:**
To stop recording your Linux screen using ffmpeg, you can press the "q" key in the terminal where ffmpeg is running. ffmpeg will then stop recording and save the output file.

**Prompt:**
I dont have access to its terminal, its running from a script

**Response:**
If you're running ffmpeg from a script and don't have access to the terminal, you can use another method to stop the recording. One way is to create a separate script or program that will send a termination signal to the ffmpeg process.

Here's an example using a simple Python script:

1. Create a new file, e.g., `stop_recording.py`, and open it in a text editor.
2. Add the following code to the file:

```python
import os
import signal

def stop_recording():
    # Find the process ID (PID) of the ffmpeg process
    pids = [pid for pid in os.listdir('/proc') if pid.isdigit()]
    for pid in pids:
        try:
            cmd = open(os.path.join('/proc', pid, 'cmdline'), 'rb').read()
            if b'ffmpeg' in cmd:
                os.kill(int(pid), signal.SIGTERM)
                print('ffmpeg process stopped.')
                return
        except IOError:
            continue

    print('ffmpeg process not found.')

stop_recording()
```

3. Save the file and exit the text editor.
4. Make the script executable by running the following command in the terminal:

```bash
chmod +x stop_recording.py
```

5. Once you're ready to stop the recording, execute the script by running:

```bash
./stop_recording.py
```

The script will search for the ffmpeg process and send a termination signal (SIGTERM) to stop it. It will print a message if the process is successfully stopped or if it's not found.

Note that this method relies on finding the ffmpeg process by searching for the `ffmpeg` keyword in the process command line. If you have multiple ffmpeg processes running, it may not work as expected.
