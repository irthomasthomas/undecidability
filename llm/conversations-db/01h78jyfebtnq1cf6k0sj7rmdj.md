**Prompt:**
Help me think through this idea carefully. 
I want to automate setting up a new kde activity and templates, as well as notes in obsidian.
Location for notes will be $HOME/Activities/$Activity/Notes
and these will be symlinked to $HOME/Notes/$Activity

The note files are:
Code_Snippets_$Activity.md
QnA_$Activity.md
Todo_$Activity.md
Ideas_$Activity.md

Thoughts.md
Shopping.md


Each activity should be associated to a git project, so that all work and notes for a project are saved.
Option to create new git, choose local git, or clone one from url.

Each activity should have a list of dropdown apps. These are activity specific instances of apps.
The apps will be opened and made into dropdowns with tdrop.

Each activity will have a .streamdeck_ui.json file. When switching activity, the file should be copied
from the $Activity folder to the $HOME and streamdeck restarded.


I want each activity to have seperate notes. I also want to keep a Master or Group notebook which contains
the notes from all activities in one file. So that $HOME/Notes/QnA.md contains the QnA notes from all
activities, e.g.
$HOME/Activities/ActivityOne/Notes/QnA_ActivityOne.md
and
$HOME/Activities/ActivityTwo/Notes/QnA_ActivityTwo.md
Should both be merged into $HOME/Notes/QnA.md with a field noting the source Activity.

**Response:**
It seems like you have a clear idea of what you want to automate. Here are some suggestions to help you think through this idea carefully:

1. Consider the scalability: How many activities do you anticipate having? Will the number of activities increase over time? Make sure the automation process can handle a large number of activities without any performance issues.

2. File organization: The file structure you proposed seems logical, but consider if it will be easy to navigate and manage when you have multiple activities. Think about how you will handle renaming or deleting activities, and if the file organization will support these actions efficiently.

3. Git integration: Think about how you will integrate with Git and ensure that the automation process will work seamlessly with different Git operations (e.g., creating a new repository, cloning an existing one, pulling/pushing changes, etc.). Consider how you will handle conflicts if there are multiple people working on the same activity.

4. Streamdeck integration: Ensure that the automation process can properly handle the file copy operation for the .streamdeck_ui.json file and restart the Streamdeck application. Make sure to test this functionality thoroughly to ensure a smooth transition between activities.

5. Note merging: Think about how you will merge the activity-specific notes into the master/group notebook. Consider using a consistent format or metadata field in each note file to indicate the source activity. Plan out the logic for merging the notes and ensure that it is error-free and doesn't result in any data loss or duplication.

6. Backup and data integrity: Consider implementing a backup mechanism to ensure that all notes and associated files are safely stored. Regularly back up the data to prevent any loss or corruption.

7. User interface: Think about how you will interact with this automation process. Design a user-friendly interface, if applicable, to streamline the setup and management of activities, notes, and associated files.

8. Error handling: Plan for potential errors or issues that may arise during the automation process. Consider implementing error handling and logging mechanisms to help diagnose and resolve any problems promptly.

9. Test thoroughly: Before implementing the automation process, thoroughly test it with different scenarios and edge cases. This will help identify and resolve any issues or improvements before it becomes operational.

Remember, careful planning and consideration of potential scenarios will help ensure the success of your automation project.
