**Prompt:**
Help me think through this idea carefully. 
I want to automate setting up a new kde activity and templates, as well as notes in obsidian.
Location for notes will be $HOME/Activities/$Activity/Notes
and these will be symlinked to $HOME/Notes/$Activity

The note files are:
Code_Snippets_$Activity.md
QnA_$Activity.md
Todo_$Activity.md
Ideas_$Activity.md

Thoughts.md
Shopping.md


Each activity should be associated to a git project, so that all work and notes for a project are saved.
Option to create new git, choose local git, or clone one from url.

Each activity should have a list of dropdown apps. These are activity specific instances of apps.
The apps will be opened and made into dropdowns with tdrop.

Each activity will have a .streamdeck_ui.json file. When switching activity, the file should be copied
from the $Activity folder to the $HOME and streamdeck restarded.


I want each activity to have seperate notes. I also want to keep a Master or Group notebook which contains
the notes from all activities in one file. So that $HOME/Notes/QnA.md contains the QnA notes from all
activities, e.g.
$HOME/Activities/ActivityOne/Notes/QnA_ActivityOne.md
and
$HOME/Activities/ActivityTwo/Notes/QnA_ActivityTwo.md
Should both be merged into $HOME/Notes/QnA.md with a field noting the source Activity.

**Response:**
To automate the setup of a new KDE activity and templates, as well as notes in Obsidian, you can follow these steps:

1. Determine the location for the notes. Based on your description, the location should be `$HOME/Activities/$Activity/Notes`, where `$Activity` represents the name of the activity. You want to symlink these notes to `$HOME/Notes/$Activity`.

2. Create the necessary note files within each activity folder. The note files you listed are:
   - `Code_Snippets_$Activity.md`
   - `QnA_$Activity.md`
   - `Todo_$Activity.md`
   - `Ideas_$Activity.md`
   - `Thoughts.md`
   - `Shopping.md`

3. Associate each activity with a Git project. This will allow you to save all work and notes for a project. Provide the option to create a new git repository, select an existing local git repository, or clone one from a URL.

4. Implement a feature to create a list of dropdown apps for each activity. These are activity-specific instances of apps. You can use a tool like `tdrop` to open and make these apps into dropdowns.

5. For each activity, create a `.streamdeck_ui.json` file that corresponds to its specific setup. When switching activities, copy this file from the `$Activity` folder to `$HOME` and restart the Stream Deck application.

6. Set up separate notes for each activity. This can be achieved by creating individual note files for each activity, as mentioned in step 2. For example, create `$HOME/Activities/ActivityOne/Notes/QnA_ActivityOne.md` and `$HOME/Activities/ActivityTwo/Notes/QnA_ActivityTwo.md` for QnA notes. 

7. To maintain a Master or Group notebook that contains the notes from all activities in one file, you can merge the activity-specific notes into a single file. For instance, `$HOME/Notes/QnA.md` can contain the QnA notes from both `QnA_ActivityOne.md` and `QnA_ActivityTwo.md`. Make sure to include a field in the merged file to indicate the source activity.

By automating these steps, you will simplify the setup process for new activities, create activity-specific notes and configurations, and maintain a consolidated view of all notes in a Master or Group notebook.
