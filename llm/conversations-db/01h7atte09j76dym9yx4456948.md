**Prompt:**
What is the exact zsh or bash command to: reinstall apps?

**Response:**
There is no exact command to reinstall all apps in one go. It depends on the package manager you are using and the specific apps you want to reinstall. However, you can use the package manager's reinstall command for individual packages. For example, in apt (used by Debian-based systems), you can use:

```
sudo apt-get install --reinstall <package-name>
```

Replace `<package-name>` with the name of the package you want to reinstall.
