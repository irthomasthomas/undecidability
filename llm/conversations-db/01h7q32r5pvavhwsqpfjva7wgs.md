I am adhd and trying to create and program a system to help me. It is currently a collection of shell scripts and kde customizations running on manjaro. I want to explore process and software ideas to work around my adhd symptoms. I want you to be highly critical of my ideas. Red team me, so that I can home in on the most realistic ideas. My main idea is this: To use kde activities to seperate work on different projects. Each activity should be created based on a template. We will create an activity with a kde plasma environment that displays only the apps for the template and those selected for the activity, to minimize distractions. Each activity should have: a local directory for large files like screen-recordings, a github project, a list of applications that should be visible, a list of windows that should be opened using tdrop dropdown maker. This info should be stored in some sort of config file. Here is the main problem statemnt I want to work on now: I cannot be trusted to not get distracted. Therefore, I need an llm to arbitrate my computer work and only allow access to relevant resources. The way it could work: everything I do should be associated to a project and an github issue. When I start the computer, ask me what task I would like to work on, either by choosing an existing task from a list, or creating a new one. The task list is a list of open issues for each project/activity. Then, open the relevant application windows and documents using tdrop. From then on, block me from switching activities for 20 minutes. During this time, any attempt to open apps, docs, or websites that are not on the Activity whitelist should prompt me in the terminal or with a dialog box to enter a justification for the work. Then make a determination about the validity of the request. If you think that the request is valid, then proceed to open the resource and update the current activity state. If you think that the justifaction is not good, or that the work is low priority, or too much work, too distracting, too ambitious, or untimely etc, then politely inform me. Say that you have noted the job to do later, and add it to the list of jobs. Then remind me of the current goal, and where I am up to so I can jump back in. Start by summarizing all this for me. Make sure to capture all the details

Based on your description, your main idea is to utilize KDE activities to separate work on different projects and minimize distractions. Each activity would be created based on a template and have specific applications, directories, and windows associated with it. You also mentioned the need for an arbiter that restricts your access to irrelevant resources and prompts you to justify any attempts to deviate from the current activity. Here is a summary of the main points:

1. Utilizing KDE activities: Organizing your work using KDE activities can help you better manage different projects and minimize distractions by creating separate environments for each activity.

2. Activity templates and customization: Creating templates for activities allows for consistency across projects and ensures that each activity has predefined applications, directories, and windows associated with it. This helps streamline your workflow and reduces the time spent on setting up your workspace for each project.

3. Implementation of an arbiter: The arbiter acts as a gatekeeper to prevent distractions and ensure that you stay focused on relevant tasks. It prompts you to choose a task from a list or create a new one upon computer startup. It then opens the necessary applications and documents using the tdrop dropdown maker. For a specified duration, it blocks you from switching activities and prompts you to justify any attempts to access resources outside of the current activity. Based on your justification, the arbiter determines whether to grant access or inform you politely of the need to prioritize or defer the task.

Additional note: When implementing the arbiter, it would be helpful to have a clearly defined set of criteria for determining the validity of requests and suitable justifications. This criteria can assist in making consistent and fair decisions regarding resource access during the blocked period.

**Prompt:**
Critique the idea. Could it help an adhd person? Is it really practical?

**Response:**
While your idea of using KDE activities and an arbiter to manage and minimize distractions shows potential, it is important to critically evaluate its practicality and effectiveness for individuals with ADHD. Here are some points to consider:

1. Effectiveness for ADHD: The idea of creating separate activities and restricting access to irrelevant resources can be beneficial for individuals with ADHD who struggle with focus and organization. By providing structure and minimizing distractions, it may help improve productivity and task management. However, it's important to remember that individual experiences and needs vary, and what works for one person may not work for another.

2. Complexity and Maintenance: Setting up and maintaining the system you described, which involves configuring templates, directory structures, activity associations, and an arbiter, may require a significant amount of time and effort. It's crucial to assess whether the potential benefits outweigh the complexity and ongoing maintenance required. Consider whether you have the resources and willingness to invest in the system's setup and upkeep.

3. Flexibility vs. Rigidity: While the system aims to provide structure and minimize distractions, it's essential to strike a balance between structure and flexibility. ADHD individuals often benefit from adapting to changing priorities, exploring new ideas, and having the freedom to switch tasks when needed. It is important to ensure that the system allows for necessary flexibility and does not become overly rigid or restrictive.

Additional note: It might be helpful to pilot the system on a smaller scale first to observe how well it addresses your specific ADHD challenges. This will allow you to evaluate its practicality, effectiveness, and potential need for adjustments before fully implementing it into your workflow. Additionally, consulting with a healthcare professional or ADHD specialist may provide additional insights and personalized recommendations to support your specific needs.
