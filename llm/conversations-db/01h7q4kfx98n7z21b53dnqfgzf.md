**Prompt:**
Which version is grammatically correct: I will be in the pit, again, with dad. I will be in the pit again with dad.

**Response:**
Both versions are grammatically correct. The use of commas in the first version ("I will be in the pit, again, with dad") indicates a slight pause or emphasis on the word "again." The second version ("I will be in the pit again with dad") does not use commas and presents the sentence without any additional emphasis.
