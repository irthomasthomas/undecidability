**Prompt:**
what should I do after adding a second nvidia gpu to manjaro?

**Response:**
After adding a second NVIDIA GPU to Manjaro, there are a few steps you can follow:

1. Check hardware compatibility: Ensure that both GPUs are compatible with Manjaro and have proper driver support. Visit the NVIDIA website or the Manjaro forums to verify compatibility and download the necessary drivers.

2. Install and configure drivers: Install the appropriate NVIDIA drivers for your GPUs. You can use the Manjaro Hardware Detection tool or the command line to install the drivers. Once installed, configure the drivers to recognize both GPUs.

3. Set up SLI or Multi-GPU support: If you want to utilize both GPUs for gaming or other GPU-intensive tasks, you may need to enable SLI (Scalable Link Interface) or Multi-GPU support. Refer to the NVIDIA documentation or the Manjaro forums for instructions on how to set this up.

Additional note: It's important to note that not all applications or games support SLI or Multi-GPU configurations. Make sure to check the compatibility of the software you intend to use before expecting performance gains from multiple GPUs.
