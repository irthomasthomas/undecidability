   sudo pacman -Syu
   ```

3. Remove CUDA 10.2: Run the following command to remove CUDA 10.2 and its dependencies:

   ```

5. Reboot your system: After the installation is complete, it is recommended to reboot your system to ensure that all changes take effect.

Please note that rolling back CUDA versions may have implications for software that depends on specific CUDA versions. Make sure to check the compatibility of your software with CUDA 10.1 before proceeding with the rollback.
