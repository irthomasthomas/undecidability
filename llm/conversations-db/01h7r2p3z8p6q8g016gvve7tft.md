**Prompt:**
How can I roll back cuda 10.2 to cuda 10.1 in manjaro? I currently have branch testing enabled and cuda 10.2 installed. I want to go back to using cuda 10.1 from the stable branch


**Response:**
To roll back CUDA 10.2 to CUDA 10.1 in Manjaro, you can follow these steps:

1. Open a terminal.
2. Disable the testing branch by editing the `/etc/pacman-mirrors.conf` file. Comment out the line that starts with `Branch=` by adding a `#` at the beginning of the line.
3. Update the package list by running the following command:
   ```
   sudo pacman -Sy
   ```
4. Remove CUDA 10.2 by running the following command:
   ```
   sudo pacman -R cuda
   ```
5. Install CUDA 10.1 from the stable branch by running the following command:
   ```
   sudo pacman -S cuda
   ```

Please note that rolling back packages can sometimes cause compatibility issues. Make sure to backup any important data and proceed with caution.
