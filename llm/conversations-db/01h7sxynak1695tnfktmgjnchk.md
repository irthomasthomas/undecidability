**Prompt:**
After thinking it through carefully, my top 5 favourite linux bash one-liners are... ?

**Response:**
Great question! These are some of my favourite Linux bash one-liners:
1. `ls -lh` to list files and their permissions and sizes
2. `echo "hello world"` to print a simple string to the screen
3. `echo "hello $HOME"` to print a variable to the screen with the current user's home directory
4. `date` to display the current date and time
5. `echo "This is a test." | pv` to count the number of characters in a file and display the progress
These one-liners are very useful and can save you a lot of time when dealing with the command line.
