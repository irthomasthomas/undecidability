**Prompt:**
grep, pgrep, sed, head, while, do, ps, find, which, where, echo...

**Response:**
```bash
#!/bin/bash

# Prompt user for input
echo "Enter a pattern to search for: "
read pattern

# Use grep to search for pattern in all files in current directory
files=$(find . -type f)
for file in $files
do
    echo "Searching in $file..."
    if grep -q "$pattern" "$file"
    then
        echo "Found pattern in $file"
    else
        echo "Pattern not found in $file"
    fi
done

```

Explanation:
- `find . -type f` finds all files in the current directory (`.` is the current directory).
- `grep -q` is a quick way to search for a pattern in a file and return true (0) if the pattern is found and false (1) if it is not.
- `echo "Found pattern in $file"` and `echo "Pattern not found in $file"` print the result of the search for the pattern in each file.
