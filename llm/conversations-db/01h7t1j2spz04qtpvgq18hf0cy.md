COMPLETE LIST OF POSIX SYNTAX

**Response:**
mv [options] source destination

Description:
The command moves (renames) files or directories from the source to the destination. The source and destination arguments can be files or directories. If the destination is a directory, the source file is moved into it. If the destination already exists, it is overwritten. If the source is a directory, all its contents are moved to the destination directory.

Options:
-b, --backup: make a backup of each file before overwriting. The backup file has the same name as the original file, with a "~" (tilde) appended.

-f, --force: do not prompt before overwriting.

-i, --interactive: prompt before overwriting (overrides the -f option).

-n, --no-clobber: do not overwrite an existing file.

-P, --no-dereference: treat destination symbolic links as normal files.

-u, --update: move only when the SOURCE file is newer than the destination file or when the destination file is missing.

-v, --verbose: explain what is being done.

-x, --one-file-system: stay on this file system. Do not cross filesystem boundaries.
