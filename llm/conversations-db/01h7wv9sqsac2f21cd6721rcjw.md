**Prompt:**
run a terminal command and enter the output to the cursor position in the active window


**Response:**
To enter the output of a terminal command into the cursor position of the active window, you can use the `xdotool` command-line tool. However, please note that `xdotool` may not be installed by default on your system, so you may need to install it first.

Once you have `xdotool` installed, you can use the following command to achieve the desired result:

```bash
<command> | xdotool type --clearmodifiers --delay 0 --file -
```

Replace `<command>` with the actual terminal command you want to run. This command will pipe the output of the command to `xdotool`, which will then type the output into the active window at the cursor position.

Please keep in mind that this method relies on the active window being able to receive text input. Additionally, it may not work as expected in certain applications or contexts.
