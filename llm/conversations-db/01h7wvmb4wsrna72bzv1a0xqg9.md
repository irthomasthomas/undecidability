**Prompt:**
What is the exact zsh command to: delete the last zsh history or from the .zhistory file directly?

**Response:**
To delete the last zsh history entry, you can use the following command:

```shell
fc -R -1
```

To delete the entire zsh history, you can use the following command:

```shell
fc -R
```

Please note that these commands will only remove the history from the current session. If you want to delete the history permanently from the `.zhistory` file, you can use the `rm` command:

```shell
rm ~/.zhistory
```

However, be cautious when deleting the `.zhistory` file, as it will remove all the history entries permanently.
