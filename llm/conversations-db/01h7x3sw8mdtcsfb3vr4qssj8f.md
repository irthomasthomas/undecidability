**Prompt:**
whats the difference between alias and export commands?


**Response:**
The `alias` and `export` commands serve different purposes in the Linux shell.

The `alias` command is used to create shortcuts or abbreviations for longer commands. It allows you to define a custom name for a command or a sequence of commands. For example, you can create an alias like `alias ll='ls -l'`, which will make the `ll` command equivalent to `ls -l`. Aliases are typically used to save time and typing effort by creating shorter and more memorable commands.

On the other hand, the `export` command is used to set environment variables. Environment variables are values that can be accessed by programs and scripts running in the shell. They provide information about the system's configuration, user preferences, and other runtime parameters. The `export` command allows you to define or modify environment variables and make them available to other processes or subshells.

In summary, `alias` is used to create shortcuts for commands, while `export` is used to set environment variables.
