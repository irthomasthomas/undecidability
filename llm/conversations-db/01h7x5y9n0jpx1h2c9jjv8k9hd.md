**Prompt:**
update the command, if the -x is not set, echo NOT EXECUTABLE, and append that path to $HOME/Development/list_of
_no_x_files_in_path.txt


**Response:**
To update the command to echo "NOT EXECUTABLE" and append the path to `$HOME/Development/list_of_no_x_files_in_path.txt` if the `-x` flag is not set, you can use the following script:

```bash
#!/bin/bash

if [[ ! -x "$1" ]]; then
    echo "NOT EXECUTABLE"
    echo "$1" >> "$HOME/Development/list_of_no_x_files_in_path.txt"
fi
```

Save the script to a file, for example, `check_executable.sh`. Then, make the script executable by running the following command:

```bash
chmod +x check_executable.sh
```

You can now use the script by passing the file path as an argument, like this:

```bash
./check_executable.sh /path/to/file
```

If the file is not executable, it will echo "NOT EXECUTABLE" and append the path to `$HOME/Development/list_of_no_x_files_in_path.txt`.
