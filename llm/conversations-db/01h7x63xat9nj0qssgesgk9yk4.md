**Prompt:**
What is the exact zsh command to: for file in $PATH; do if [[ -x $file && -f $file && $(head -n 1 $file) == "#!"* ]]; then echo $file && echo $file >> $HOME/Development/list_of_scripts_in_PATH.txt; fi done
update this script to include logic like: if [[ ! -x "$1" ]]; then
    echo "NOT EXECUTABLE"
    echo "$1" >> "$HOME/Development/list_of_no_x_files_in_path.txt"
?

**Response:**
for file in $PATH; do 
    if [[ -x $file && -f $file && $(head -n 1 $file) == "#!"* ]]; then 
        echo $file && echo $file >> $HOME/Development/list_of_scripts_in_PATH.txt; 
    elif [[ ! -x "$file" ]]; then
        echo "NOT EXECUTABLE"
        echo "$file" >> "$HOME/Development/list_of_no_x_files_in_path.txt"
    fi
done

**Prompt:**
is not the -f redundent?

**Response:**
You're correct, the `-f` option is redundant in this case. The `-x` option already checks if the file exists and is executable. Here's the updated command without the `-f` option:

```zsh
for file in $PATH; do 
    if [[ -x $file && $(head -n 1 $file) == "#!"* ]]; then 
        echo $file && echo $file >> $HOME/Development/list_of_scripts_in_PATH.txt; 
    elif [[ ! -x "$file" ]]; then
        echo "NOT EXECUTABLE"
        echo "$file" >> "$HOME/Development/list_of_no_x_files_in_path.txt"
    fi
done
```

**Prompt:**
make the elif check its a -f

**Response:**
Apologies for the confusion. To check if a file is not executable and also a regular file (`-f`), you can update the command as follows:

```zsh
for file in $PATH/*; do 
    if [[ -x $file && $(head -n 1 $file) == "#!"* ]]; then 
        echo $file && echo $file >> $HOME/Development/list_of_scripts_in_PATH.txt; 
    elif [[ ! -x "$file" && -f "$file" ]]; then
        echo "NOT EXECUTABLE"
        echo "$file" >> "$HOME/Development/list_of_no_x_files_in_path.txt"
    fi
done
```

This will now correctly check if the file is not executable (`! -x`) and also a regular file (`-f`).
