**Prompt:**
What is the exact zsh command to: cache curl results?

**Response:**
There is no exact zsh command to cache curl results. However, you can use a combination of zsh functions and caching mechanisms to achieve this. Here's an example:

1. Create a zsh function to cache curl results:
```zsh
cache_curl() {
    local cache_dir="$HOME/.curl_cache"
    local cache_file="$cache_dir/$(echo "$1" | md5sum | cut -d ' ' -f 1)"

    if [[ -f "$cache_file" ]]; then
        cat "$cache_file"
    else
        mkdir -p "$cache_dir"
        curl "$1" > "$cache_file"
        cat "$cache_file"
    fi
}
```

2. Add the function to your zsh configuration file (e.g., `~/.zshrc`):
```zsh
autoload -Uz cache_curl
```

3. Restart your zsh session or run `source ~/.zshrc` to load the updated configuration.

4. Now you can use the `cache_curl` function to cache curl results. For example:
```zsh
cache_curl "https://example.com"
```

This will cache the curl result from `https://example.com` and retrieve it from the cache on subsequent calls.

Note: This implementation uses a simple file-based cache using the MD5 hash of the URL as the cache file name. You can modify it to suit your specific caching requirements.
