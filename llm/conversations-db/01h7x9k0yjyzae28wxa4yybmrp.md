**Prompt:**
what do you make of this solution? Solution from chatgpt3:  There is no exact zsh command to cache curl results. However, you can use a combination of zsh functions and caching mechanisms to achieve this. Here's an example: 1. Create a zsh function to cache curl results: ```zsh cache_curl() { local cache_dir="$HOME/.curl_cache" local cache_file="$cache_dir/$(echo "$1" | md5sum | cut -d ' ' -f 1)" if [[ -f "$cache_file" ]]; then cat "$cache_file" else mkdir -p "$cache_dir" curl "$1" > "$cache_file" cat "$cache_file" fi } ``` 2. Add the function to your zsh configuration file (e.g., `~/.zshrc`): ```zsh autoload -Uz cache_curl ``` 3. Restart your zsh session or run `source ~/.zshrc` to load the updated configuration. 4. Now you can use the `cache_curl` function to cache curl results. For example: ```zsh cache_curl "https://example.com" ``` This will cache the curl result from `https://example.com` and retrieve it from the cache on subsequent calls. Note: This implementation uses a simple file-based cache using the MD5 hash of the URL as the cache file name. You can modify it to suit your specific caching requirements. 

think it through carefully

**Response:**
This solution seems useful for scenarios where you want to store results from curl commands for later use, saving time and potentially network resources. It seems to work by creating a cache directory in the user's home directory and storing results of curl calls in files within this directory. These files are named using an MD5 hash of the url that the curl call was made to, ensuring uniqueness for each different url.

There is an if-else construct that checks whether a file corresponding to the hash of the url already exists. If it does, it simply cat's the file (which contains the result from a previous curl call). If it does not exist, it uses curl to fetch the result, stores it in the file, and then cats the file.

This seems like a neat and simple way to cache results of curl calls. However, this is a very basic form of caching and there are few things to be aware of:

1. There is no expiration logic. Once a result is cached, it will be used indefinitely. There is no logic to refresh the cache after a certain period of time.
2. Concurrent writes aren't handled. If two shells try to write to the same cache file at the same time, you might end up with a corrupted cache file.
3. Large outputs from curl can fill up your disk space as it stores the whole output in a file.
4. Not handling HTTP response codes. It will also store the response from the server in case of an error (4xx or 5xx status codes).
5. There's no handling for different curl calls to the same URL with different parameters.

As long as you are aware of these limitations, and they are not issues for your specific use case, then this could be a handy piece of functionality to have in your zsh setup.
