**Prompt:**
what do you make of this solution? Solution from chatgpt3:  There is no exact zsh command to cache curl results. However, you can use a combination of zsh functions and caching mechanisms to achieve this. Here's an example: 1. Create a zsh function to cache curl results: ```zsh cache_curl() { local cache_dir="$HOME/.curl_cache" local cache_file="$cache_dir/$(echo "$1" | md5sum | cut -d ' ' -f 1)" if [[ -f "$cache_file" ]]; then cat "$cache_file" else mkdir -p "$cache_dir" curl "$1" > "$cache_file" cat "$cache_file" fi } ``` 2. Add the function to your zsh configuration file (e.g., `~/.zshrc`): ```zsh autoload -Uz cache_curl ``` 3. Restart your zsh session or run `source ~/.zshrc` to load the updated configuration. 4. Now you can use the `cache_curl` function to cache curl results. For example: ```zsh cache_curl "https://example.com" ``` This will cache the curl result from `https://example.com` and retrieve it from the cache on subsequent calls. Note: This implementation uses a simple file-based cache using the MD5 hash of the URL as the cache file name. You can modify it to suit your specific caching requirements. 

think it through carefully

**Response:**
This solution provides a way to cache the results of curl commands in the zsh shell using a combination of zsh functions and caching mechanisms. Here's a breakdown of the solution:

1. A zsh function named `cache_curl` is created. This function takes a URL as a parameter and performs the following steps:
   - It defines a cache directory and file path based on the URL's MD5 hash.
   - If the cache file exists, it retrieves the content from the cache and outputs it.
   - If the cache file does not exist, it creates the cache directory if necessary, executes the curl command to fetch the URL content, stores the result in the cache file, and then outputs it.

2. The `cache_curl` function is added to the zsh configuration file, which means it will be available for use in future zsh sessions. The `autoload` command ensures that the function is loaded when needed.

3. To apply the updated zsh configuration, the zsh session needs to be restarted, or the `source ~/.zshrc` command can be run to reload the configuration.

4. With the `cache_curl` function set up, it can be used to cache the results of curl commands. An example usage is provided in the solution, demonstrating how to call the `cache_curl` function with a specific URL.

It's important to note that this implementation uses a simplistic file-based caching approach with the MD5 hash of the URL as the cache file name. Depending on specific caching requirements, this solution may need modification.

Overall, this solution offers a workable approach for caching curl results within the zsh shell by leveraging zsh functions and file-based caching.
