**Prompt:**
What is the exact zsh command to: read closed issues of another persons public github repo?

**Response:**
To read closed issues of another person's public GitHub repository using the zsh command, you can use the GitHub API. Here's an example command:

```zsh
curl -s "https://api.github.com/repos/{owner}/{repo}/issues?state=closed"
```

Replace `{owner}` with the username or organization name of the repository owner, and `{repo}` with the name of the repository.

Note: This command will only retrieve the first page of closed issues. If there are multiple pages, you may need to modify the command to fetch additional pages using pagination parameters provided by the GitHub API.
