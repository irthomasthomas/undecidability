**Prompt:**
What is the exact zsh command to: how to enclose a string so nothing can escape, even if the string already contains single and double quotes?

**Response:**
To enclose a string so that nothing can escape, even if the string already contains single and double quotes, you can use the `printf` command in zsh with the `%q` format specifier. Here's the command:

```zsh
printf '%q' "your string here"
```

Replace `"your string here"` with the actual string you want to enclose. The `printf` command with `%q` will escape any special characters, including single and double quotes, in the string.
