**Prompt:**
make this computer accessible from the web with ssh


**Response:**
To make your computer accessible from the web with SSH, you need to configure your router to forward incoming SSH traffic to your computer's local IP address. Here's a general outline of the steps involved:

1. Determine your computer's local IP address: Open a terminal and run the command `ip addr show` or `ifconfig` to find your computer's IP address. Look for an entry that starts with "inet" or "inet addr" followed by the IP address.

2. Configure port forwarding on your router: Access your router's settings page by entering its IP address in a web browser. Look for the "Port Forwarding" or "Virtual Server" section. Create a new port forwarding rule to forward incoming traffic on port 22 (SSH default port) to your computer's local IP address.

3. Set up a static IP address for your computer: To ensure that your computer always receives the same IP address from your router, configure a static IP address for your computer. This step varies depending on your operating system and router model. Consult your router's documentation for instructions.

4. Configure your firewall: If you have a firewall enabled on your computer, make sure to allow incoming SSH connections on port 22. The process for configuring the firewall depends on the firewall software you are using.

5. Test the SSH connection: Once the port forwarding and firewall configurations are in place, you should be able to access your computer from the web using SSH. Test the connection by attempting to connect to your public IP address from a remote device using an SSH client.

Please note that exposing your computer to the internet carries security risks. Ensure that you have strong passwords and consider using key-based authentication instead of password authentication for SSH. Additionally, keep your system and SSH software up to date with the latest security patches.
