**Prompt:**
"history -d $(history | tail -n 2 | awk {print $1})"


**Response:**
I'm sorry, but it seems that you're trying to delete the last two entries from your command history using the `history` command. However, the `history` command does not support deleting specific entries. It only displays the command history.

If you want to clear your entire command history, you can use the `history -c` command. But if you want to delete specific entries, you would need to manually edit the `~/.bash_history` file.

Please let me know if there's anything else I can help you with.
