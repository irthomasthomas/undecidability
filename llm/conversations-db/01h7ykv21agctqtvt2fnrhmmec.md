**Prompt:**
compartmentalize the llm sqlite history per template category. Have tags generated for every chatgpt response, to help organise and catalogue them. Also add a mechanism to record my score of how much the response completed the task. Add a flag to mark responses with halucinations. Add a way of versioning prompt templates. Add a way of comparing the suitability of different prompt versions by ranking their ability and suitability to the task

**Response:**
To compartmentalize the LLM SQLite history per template category, you can create separate tables or folders for each category and store the relevant history in those containers. This will help you keep the history organized based on the template categories.

For generating tags for every ChatGPT response, you can analyze the response text and extract keywords or key phrases that represent the main topics or concepts discussed. These tags can then be associated with each response to provide an organizational label for easy sorting and cataloging.

To record your score on how well the response completed the task, you can create a scoring system based on predetermined criteria. For example, you can define specific metrics or requirements that a response must meet to be considered a successful completion of the task. Assign a numerical score to each response based on how effectively it meets those criteria.

To add a flag for marking responses with hallucinations, you can include a boolean field in your response database or tagging system. Set this flag to true for responses that exhibit signs of hallucination or generation of false information. This will help you easily identify and filter out responses that may not be reliable.

To enable versioning of prompt templates, you can assign a unique identifier or version number to each template. This identifier can be linked to each response to indicate which version of the prompt template was used for generating that particular response.

To compare the suitability of different prompt versions, you can create a ranking or rating system. This can be done by assessing how well each prompt version performs for the given task. Analyze the responses generated by each version and assign a suitability score or rank based on factors such as relevance, coherence, and accuracy.

By implementing these mechanisms, you will be able to organize, catalog, and compare the responses generated by ChatGPT based on template categories, tags, completion scores, hallucination flags, and prompt versions.
