NAME
       fc — process the command history list

SYNOPSIS
       fc [-r] [-e editor] [first [last]]

       fc -l [-nr] [first [last]]

       fc -s [old=new] [first]

DESCRIPTION
       The fc utility shall list, or shall edit and re-execute, commands previously entered to an interactive sh.

       The  command  history  list shall reference commands by number. The first number in the list is selected arbitrarily.
       The relationship of a number to its command shall not change except when the user logs in and no other process is ac‐
       cessing the list, at which time the system may reset the numbering to start the oldest retained  command  at  another
       number (usually 1). When the number reaches an implementation-defined upper limit, which shall be no smaller than the
       value  in  HISTSIZE or 32767 (whichever is greater), the shell may wrap the numbers, starting the next command with a
       lower number (usually 1). However, despite this optional wrapping of numbers, fc shall maintain the time-ordering se‐
       quence of the commands. For example, if four commands in sequence are given the numbers 32766,  32767,  1  (wrapped),
       and 2 as they are executed, command 32767 is considered the command previous to 1, even though its number is higher.

       When  commands  are  edited (when the -l option is not specified), the resulting lines shall be entered at the end of
       the history list and then re-executed by sh.  The fc command that caused the editing shall not be  entered  into  the
       history  list.  If the editor returns a non-zero exit status, this shall suppress the entry into the history list and
       the command re-execution.  Any command line variable assignments or redirection operators used with fc  shall  affect
       both the fc command itself as well as the command that results; for example:

           fc -s -- -1 2>/dev/null

       reinvokes the previous command, suppressing standard error for both fc and the previous command.

OPTIONS
       The fc utility shall conform to the Base Definitions volume of POSIX.1‐2017, Section 12.2, Utility Syntax Guidelines.

       The following options shall be supported:

       -e editor Use the editor named by editor to edit the commands. The editor string is a utility name, subject to search
                 via  the PATH variable (see the Base Definitions volume of POSIX.1‐2017, Chapter 8, Environment Variables).
                 The value in the FCEDIT variable shall be used as a default when -e is not specified. If FCEDIT is null  or
                 unset, ed shall be used as the editor.

       -l        (The  letter  ell.) List the commands rather than invoking an editor on them. The commands shall be written
                 in the sequence indicated by the first and last operands, as affected by -r, with each command preceded  by
                 the command number.

       -n        Suppress command numbers when listing with -l.

       -r        Reverse the order of the commands listed (with -l) or edited (with neither -l nor -s).

       -s        Re-execute the command without invoking an editor.

OPERANDS
       The following operands shall be supported:

       first, last
                 Select  the  commands to list or edit. The number of previous commands that can be accessed shall be deter‐
                 mined by the value of the HISTSIZE variable. The value of first or last or both shall be one of the follow‐
                 ing:

                 [+]number A positive number representing a command number; command numbers can be displayed with the -l op‐
                           tion.

                 -number   A negative decimal number representing the command that was executed number  of  commands  previ‐
                           ously. For example, -1 is the immediately previous command.

                 string    A  string  indicating  the  most  recently  entered  command that begins with that string. If the
                           old=new operand is not also specified with -s, the string form of the first operand  cannot  con‐
                           tain an embedded <equals-sign>.

                 When the synopsis form with -s is used:

                  *  If first is omitted, the previous command shall be used.

                 For the synopsis forms without -s:

                  *  If  last  is  omitted,  last  shall default to the previous command when -l is specified; otherwise, it
                     shall default to first.

                  *  If first and last are both omitted, the previous 16 commands shall be listed  or  the  previous  single
                     command shall be edited (based on the -l option).

                  *  If first and last are both present, all of the commands from first to last shall be edited (without -l)
                     or  listed  (with -l).  Editing multiple commands shall be accomplished by presenting to the editor all
                     of the commands at one time, each command starting on a new line. If first represents a  newer  command
                     than last, the commands shall be listed or edited in reverse sequence, equivalent to using -r.  For ex‐
                     ample,  the  following  commands  on the first line are equivalent to the corresponding commands on the
                     second:

                         fc -r 10 20    fc    30 40
                         fc    20 10    fc -r 40 30

                  *  When a range of commands is used, it shall not be an error to specify first or last values that are not
                     in the history list; fc shall substitute the value representing the oldest or  newest  command  in  the
                     list,  as  appropriate.  For example, if there are only ten commands in the history list, numbered 1 to
                     10:

                         fc -l
                         fc 1 99

                     shall list and edit, respectively, all ten commands.

       old=new   Replace the first occurrence of string old in the commands to be re-executed by the string new.

STDIN
       Not used.

INPUT FILES
       None.

ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES
       The following environment variables shall affect the execution of fc:

       FCEDIT    This variable, when expanded by the shell, shall determine the default value for the -e editor option's ed‐
                 itor option-argument. If FCEDIT is null or unset, ed shall be used as the editor.

       HISTFILE  Determine a pathname naming a command history file. If the HISTFILE variable is not set, the shell may  at‐
                 tempt to access or create a file .sh_history in the directory referred to by the HOME environment variable.
                 If  the shell cannot obtain both read and write access to, or create, the history file, it shall use an un‐
                 specified mechanism that allows the history to operate properly. (References to history  ‘‘file''  in  this
                 section shall be understood to mean this unspecified mechanism in such cases.) An implementation may choose
                 to access this variable only when initializing the history file; this initialization shall occur when fc or
                 sh first attempt to retrieve entries from, or add entries to, the file, as the result of commands issued by
                 the user, the file named by the ENV variable, or implementation-defined system start-up files. In some his‐
                 torical  shells,  the history file is initialized just after the ENV file has been processed. Therefore, it
                 is implementation-defined whether changes made to HISTFILE after the history file has been initialized  are
                 effective.   Implementations  may  choose  to disable the history list mechanism for users with appropriate
                 privileges who do not set HISTFILE; the specific circumstances under which this occurs are  implementation-
                 defined.  If  more than one instance of the shell is using the same history file, it is unspecified how up‐
                 dates to the history file from those shells interact. As entries are deleted from the  history  file,  they
                 shall  be deleted oldest first. It is unspecified when history file entries are physically removed from the
                 history file.

       HISTSIZE  Determine a decimal number representing the limit to the number of previous commands that  are  accessible.
                 If  this  variable is unset, an unspecified default greater than or equal to 128 shall be used. The maximum
                 number of commands in the history list is unspecified, but shall be at least  128.  An  implementation  may
                 choose  to  access  this  variable  only  when  initializing the history file, as described under HISTFILE.
                 Therefore, it is unspecified whether changes made to HISTSIZE after the history file has  been  initialized
                 are effective.

       LANG      Provide a default value for the internationalization variables that are unset or null. (See the Base Defin‐
                 itions  volume  of POSIX.1‐2017, Section 8.2, Internationalization Variables for the precedence of interna‐
                 tionalization variables used to determine the values of locale categories.)

       LC_ALL    If set to a non-empty string value, override the values of all the other internationalization variables.

       LC_CTYPE  Determine the locale for the interpretation of sequences of bytes of text data as characters (for  example,
                 single-byte as opposed to multi-byte characters in arguments and input files).

       LC_MESSAGES
                 Determine  the  locale that should be used to affect the format and contents of diagnostic messages written
                 to standard error.

       NLSPATH   Determine the location of message catalogs for the processing of LC_MESSAGES.

ASYNCHRONOUS EVENTS
       Default.

STDOUT
       When the -l option is used to list commands, the format of each command in the list shall be as follows:

           "%d\t%s\n", <line number>, <command>

       If both the -l and -n options are specified, the format of each command shall be:

           "\t%s\n", <command>

       If the <command> consists of more than one line, the lines after the first shall be displayed as:

           "\t%s\n", <continued-command>

STDERR
       The standard error shall be used only for diagnostic messages.

OUTPUT FILES
       None.

EXTENDED DESCRIPTION
       None.

EXIT STATUS
       The following exit values shall be returned:

        0    Successful completion of the listing.

       >0    An error occurred.

       Otherwise, the exit status shall be that of the commands executed by fc.

CONSEQUENCES OF ERRORS
       Default.

       The following sections are informative.

APPLICATION USAGE
       Since editors sometimes use file descriptors as integral parts of their editing, redirecting their  file  descriptors
       as part of the fc command can produce unexpected results. For example, if vi is the FCEDIT editor, the command:

           fc -s | more

       does not work correctly on many systems.

       Users on windowing systems may want to have separate history files for each window by setting HISTFILE as follows:

           HISTFILE=$HOME/.sh_hist$$

EXAMPLES
       None.

RATIONALE
       This utility is based on the fc built-in of the KornShell.

       An  early  proposal  specified the -e option as [-e editor [old= new ]], which is not historical practice. Historical
       practice in fc of either [-e editor] or [-e - [ old= new ]] is acceptable, but not both together. To clarify this,  a
       new  option  -s  was introduced replacing the [-e -].  This resolves the conflict and makes fc conform to the Utility
       Syntax Guidelines.

       HISTFILE  Some implementations of the KornShell check for the superuser and do not create a history file unless HIST‐
                 FILE is set. This is done primarily to avoid creating unlinked files in the root file system  when  logging
                 in during single-user mode.  HISTFILE must be set for the superuser to have history.

       HISTSIZE  Needed to limit the size of history files. It is the intent of the standard developers that when two shells
                 share the same history file, commands that are entered in one shell shall be accessible by the other shell.
                 Because  of  the difficulties of synchronization over a network, the exact nature of the interaction is un‐
                 specified.

       The initialization process for the history file can be dependent on the system start-up files, in that they may  con‐
       tain  commands  that  effectively preempt the settings the user has for HISTFILE and HISTSIZE.  For example, function
       definition commands are recorded in the history file. If the system administrator includes  function  definitions  in
       some  system  start-up file called before the ENV file, the history file is initialized before the user can influence
       its characteristics. In some historical shells, the history file is initialized just after  the  ENV  file  has  been
       processed. Because of these situations, the text requires the initialization process to be implementation-defined.

       Consideration  was given to omitting the fc utility in favor of the command line editing feature in sh.  For example,
       in vi editing mode, typing "<ESC>v" is equivalent to:

           EDITOR=vi fc

       However, the fc utility allows the user the flexibility to edit multiple commands simultaneously (such as fc  10  20)
       and to use editors other than those supported by sh for command line editing.

       In  the KornShell, the alias r (‘‘re-do'') is preset to fc -e - (equivalent to the POSIX fc -s).  This is probably an
       easier command name to remember than fc (‘‘fix command''), but it does not meet the Utility Syntax  Guidelines.   Re‐
       naming  fc  to  hist or redo was considered, but since this description closely matches historical KornShell practice
       already, such a renaming was seen as gratuitous.  Users are free to create aliases whenever odd historical names such
       as fc, awk, cat, grep, or yacc are standardized by POSIX.

       Command numbers have no ordering effects; they are like serial numbers.  The -r option and  -number  operand  address
       the  sequence of command execution, regardless of serial numbers. So, for example, if the command number wrapped back
       to 1 at some arbitrary point, there would be no ambiguity associated with traversing the wrap point. For example,  if
       the command history were:

           32766: echo 1
           32767: echo 2
           1: echo 3

       the number -2 refers to command 32767 because it is the second previous command, regardless of serial number.

FUTURE DIRECTIONS
       None.
