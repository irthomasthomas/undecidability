**Prompt:**
explain: fc -s command on linux

**Response:**
The "fc -s" command in Linux is used to modify and execute the previously executed command in the command history. It allows you to edit the command before executing it.

When you run a command in the terminal, Linux keeps a history of the executed commands. With the "fc -s" command, you can refer to the previous command in the history and modify it before executing it again.

Here is the syntax:
```
fc -s old=new
```

"old" refers to the string you want to replace in the previous command, and "new" replaces the "old" string in the previous command.

For example, if the previous command was "ls -l", and you want to change it to "ls -a", you would use the "fc -s" command as follows:
```
fc -s ls=-a
```

After executing this command, it will replace "ls" with "-a" from the last executed command and execute the modified command.
