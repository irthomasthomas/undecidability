**Prompt:**
will this delete the last entry in zsh history? history -d $(history | tail -n 1 | awk {print $1})

**Response:**
No, this will not work in zsh as you intend. The command `history -d <index>` is for bash and it deletes history entry at specific <index>. 

But zsh doesn't support `history -d <index>` functionality to delete a specific history entry.

In zsh, you could manually edit the history file (generally `~/.zsh_history`) to remove entries or use HISTIGNORE environment variable to specify the command names to exclude from history.

Please, always make sure to back up your history file before making modifications, in case you accidentally delete more than intended.
