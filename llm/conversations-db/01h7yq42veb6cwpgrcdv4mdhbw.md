**Prompt:**
explain: !$


**Response:**
The expression `!$` is a combination of two symbols: `!` and `$`. 

In the context of the command line, `!` is often used as a history expansion operator. It allows you to refer to previous commands executed in the shell's history. 

On the other hand, `$` is used to access the value of a variable in many programming languages and shell environments.

However, when used together as `!$`, it has a specific meaning in some shells, including Bash. It represents the last argument of the previous command executed. 

For example, if you executed the command `ls -l /home/user/Documents`, then `!$` would expand to `/home/user/Documents`. 

It's worth noting that this behavior may vary depending on the shell you are using.
