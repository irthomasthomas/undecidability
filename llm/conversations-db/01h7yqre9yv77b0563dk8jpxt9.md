**Prompt:**
'Why, when I run: tail -n 1 ~/.zhistory | cut -d ';' -f 2-, it outputs itself'

**Response:**
The command you are running, `tail -n 1 ~/.zhistory | cut -d ';' -f 2-`, retrieves the last line from the `~/.zhistory` file, and then uses the `cut` command to extract fields starting from the second field. 

The reason it outputs itself could be because the last line of your `~/.zhistory` file contains the string you are running. 

To confirm this, you can open the `~/.zhistory` file using a text editor and check if the last line matches the command you are running.
