**Prompt:**
make this computer accessible from the web with ssh


**Response:**
To make your computer accessible from the web with SSH, you need to configure your router to forward incoming SSH traffic to your computer's local IP address. Here's a general outline of the steps involved:

1. Determine your computer's local IP address: You can find this information by running the `ip addr` command in the terminal. Look for the IP address associated with your network interface (e.g., eth0, wlan0).

2. Configure port forwarding on your router: Access your router's settings by entering its IP address in a web browser. Look for the "Port Forwarding" or "Virtual Server" section. Add a new rule to forward incoming traffic on port 22 (SSH default port) to your computer's local IP address.

3. Set up a static IP address for your computer: To ensure that your computer's IP address doesn't change, it's recommended to assign a static IP address to your computer within your local network. This can usually be done in your router's settings.

4. Configure your firewall: Make sure your computer's firewall allows incoming SSH connections. If you're using the default firewall on Manjaro, you can enable SSH access by running the following command in the terminal:
   ```
   sudo ufw allow ssh
   ```

5. Test the SSH connection: From an external network, try connecting to your computer's public IP address using an SSH client. You can find your public IP address by searching "what is my IP" in a search engine.

Please note that exposing your computer to the internet carries security risks. It's important to use strong passwords and consider additional security measures like disabling password-based authentication and using SSH keys.
