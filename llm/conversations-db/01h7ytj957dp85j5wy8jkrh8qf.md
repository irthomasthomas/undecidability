**Prompt:**
make this computer accessible from the web with ssh


**Response:**
To make your computer accessible from the web with SSH, you need to configure your router to forward incoming SSH traffic to your computer's local IP address. Here's a general outline of the steps involved:

1. Determine your computer's local IP address: Open a terminal and run the command `ip addr show` or `ifconfig` to find your computer's local IP address. It will typically be in the format of `192.168.x.x` or `10.x.x.x`.

2. Configure port forwarding on your router: Access your router's configuration page by entering its IP address in a web browser. Look for the "Port Forwarding" or "Virtual Server" section and create a new rule to forward incoming traffic on port 22 (SSH) to your computer's local IP address.

3. Set up a dynamic DNS service (optional): If your ISP assigns you a dynamic IP address, you may want to set up a dynamic DNS service to associate a domain name with your changing IP address. This will allow you to connect to your computer using a domain name instead of the IP address.

4. Configure your firewall: Ensure that your computer's firewall allows incoming SSH connections. You may need to open port 22 in your firewall settings.

5. Test the connection: Once you've completed the above steps, you should be able to access your computer from the web using SSH. Test it by connecting to your public IP address or domain name from a remote machine using an SSH client.

Please note that exposing your computer to the internet carries security risks. Make sure you have strong passwords and consider using key-based authentication instead of password authentication for SSH. Additionally, keep your system and SSH software up to date to protect against vulnerabilities.
