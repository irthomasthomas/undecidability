**Prompt:**
make this computer accessible from the web with ssh


**Response:**
To make your computer accessible from the web with SSH, you need to configure your router to forward incoming SSH traffic to your computer's local IP address. Here's a general outline of the steps involved:

1. Determine your computer's local IP address: Open a terminal and run the command `ip addr show` or `ifconfig` to find your computer's local IP address (e.g., 192.168.1.100).

2. Configure port forwarding on your router: Access your router's configuration page by entering its IP address in a web browser. Look for the "Port Forwarding" or "Virtual Server" section and create a new rule to forward incoming traffic on port 22 (SSH) to your computer's local IP address.

3. Set up a static IP address for your computer: To ensure your computer always receives the same IP address from your router, configure a static IP address in your computer's network settings. This step may vary depending on your operating system.

4. Configure your firewall: If you have a firewall enabled on your computer, make sure to allow incoming SSH connections on port 22.

5. Test the SSH connection: From an external network, try connecting to your computer's public IP address using an SSH client. You can find your public IP address by searching "what is my IP" on a search engine.

Please note that exposing your computer to the internet carries security risks. It is recommended to use strong passwords, disable root login, and consider using key-based authentication for SSH. Additionally, keep your system and SSH software up to date to protect against potential vulnerabilities.

**Prompt:**
router has option to add new static ipv4 route. it has fields for destination, mask, gateway, metric and interface. Is that the right thing?

**Response:**
No, adding a static IPv4 route on your router is not the correct approach for making your computer accessible from the web with SSH. 

Instead, you need to set up port forwarding on your router. The specific steps for configuring port forwarding may vary depending on your router's make and model.

Look for a section in your router's configuration page specifically labeled "Port Forwarding," "Virtual Server," or something similar. From there, you can create a new rule to forward incoming traffic on port 22 (SSH) to your computer's local IP address.

The fields you mentioned (destination, mask, gateway, metric, and interface) are typically used for configuring static routing tables, which determine how network traffic is forwarded between different subnets or networks within your local network. This is not directly related to making your computer accessible from the web.

If you need further assistance, please provide the brand and model of your router, and I can provide more specific instructions.

**Prompt:**
i am using technicolor router

**Response:**
For Technicolor routers, the process of configuring port forwarding to make your computer accessible from the web with SSH is as follows:

1. Open a web browser and enter your router's IP address in the address bar. The default IP address for Technicolor routers is often 192.168.0.1 or 192.168.1.1. If you're unsure, you can usually find this information in the documentation or by checking the bottom of the router itself.

2. Enter your router's username and password to log in. If you haven't changed these credentials, the default username is usually "admin" and the default password is either "admin" or blank (no password).

3. Once logged in, look for a section called "Port Forwarding" or "NAT" in the router's configuration page.

4. In the port forwarding settings, create a new rule to forward incoming traffic on port 22 (SSH) to your computer's local IP address. You will need to specify the following details:
   - External Port: 22 (or any port number you prefer)
   - Internal IP: The local IP address of your computer (e.g., 192.168.1.100)
   - Internal Port: 22
   - Protocol: TCP (SSH typically uses TCP)

5. Save the changes and exit the router's configuration page.

6. To access your computer from the web, you will need to use your router's public IP address. You can find this by searching "what is my IP" on a search engine. 

Note: Your internet service provider (ISP) may assign you a dynamic IP address, which means it can change over time. If your IP address changes, you will need to update your SSH connection accordingly.

Remember to take appropriate security measures such as using strong passwords, disabling root login, and considering key-based authentication to secure your SSH connection.

If you encounter any difficulties, consult the documentation provided by Technicolor or contact your ISP for further assistance.
