**Prompt:**
explain ln -s /home/tommy/Development/Projects/StreamDeck1/scripts /home/tommy/Development/Projects/StreamDeck/scripts/lists

**Response:**
The command "ln -s" creates a symbolic link in Linux or Unix-like operating systems. 

In this specific command, we are creating a symbolic link from the source directory /home/tommy/Development/Projects/StreamDeck1/scripts to the target directory /home/tommy/Development/Projects/StreamDeck/scripts/lists.

Symbolic links essentially act as a pointer or shortcut to another file or directory. So, when this command is executed, accessing the directory /home/tommy/Development/Projects/StreamDeck/scripts/lists will actually take us to /home/tommy/Development/Projects/StreamDeck1/scripts.

This allows for the convenience of accessing the content of the original directory, /home/tommy/Development/Projects/StreamDeck1/scripts, under a different name or location, /home/tommy/Development/Projects/StreamDeck/scripts/lists.
