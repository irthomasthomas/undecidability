**Prompt:**
explain ln -s /home/tommy/Development/Projects/StreamDeck/scripts/lists/ /home/tommy/Development/Projects/StreamDeck1/scripts 

**Response:**
The command "ln -s" creates a symbolic link. 

In this case, the command creates a symbolic link with the following syntax:

ln -s /source/directory /destination/directory

In your command:

ln -s /home/tommy/Development/Projects/StreamDeck/scripts/lists/ /home/tommy/Development/Projects/StreamDeck1/scripts

- "/home/tommy/Development/Projects/StreamDeck/scripts/lists/" is the source directory. It contains the files and directories you want to create a link to.
- "/home/tommy/Development/Projects/StreamDeck1/scripts" is the destination directory. It is the location where you want to create the symbolic link.

So, the command creates a symbolic link at "/home/tommy/Development/Projects/StreamDeck1/scripts" that points to the contents of "/home/tommy/Development/Projects/StreamDeck/scripts/lists/". This means that accessing "/home/tommy/Development/Projects/StreamDeck1/scripts" will provide access to the same files and directories as "/home/tommy/Development/Projects/StreamDeck/scripts/lists/".
