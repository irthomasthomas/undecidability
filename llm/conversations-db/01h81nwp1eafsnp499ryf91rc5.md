**Prompt:**
According to public data, roughly how many farm animals where there in Britian around 2020. Where is that data typically available?

**Response:**
Public data on the number of farm animals in Britain can be typically found on websites of government bodies such as the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (DEFRA). The exact number may vary depending on the source and type of farm animals considered. As of June 2020, according to DEFRA, there were approximately 9.6 million cattle, 33.8 million sheep, and 4.9 million pigs in the UK. Other sources might also include poultry numbers, which can be significantly higher due to their shorter lifespans and faster turnover. Please always check the most current and relevant sources as these numbers can fluctuate year by year.

**Prompt:**
Hom Many poultry? how many horses? Any other farmed animals?

**Response:**
The exact number of poultry in the UK can vary greatly as it is a rapidly changing sector due to its short production cycle. However, as per DEFRA's statistics, the poultry population was estimated to be around 173 million in 2020.

The horse population is not typically included in farming livestock statistics as they are generally not considered as farm animals. However, according to The British Equestrian Trade Associationâ€™s National Equestrian Survey 2015, there were around 944,000 horses, including those used for farming, sport, and leisure activities in the UK. More recent numbers might differ.

Other farmed animals include goats and farmed deer, among others. As of June 2020, according to DEFRA, there were approximately 99,000 goats. The number of farmed deer is less clear, as they are not included in the standard agricultural statistics.

Please note the numbers may have fluctuated and been updated since 2020 and it's always best to check the most recent statistics for the most accurate data.
