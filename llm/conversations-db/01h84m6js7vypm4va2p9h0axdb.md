**Prompt:**
What is the exact zsh command to: explain: tee -a?

**Response:**
The `tee -a` command in zsh is used to append the output of a command to a file, while also displaying it on the terminal. The `-a` option stands for "append", which means that the output will be added to the end of the file instead of overwriting it.

To explain the command `tee -a` in more detail:

- `tee` is a command that reads from standard input and writes to standard output and files simultaneously.
- `-a` is an option that tells `tee` to append the output to the specified file(s) instead of overwriting them.

So, when you use `tee -a`, the output of a command will be displayed on the terminal and also appended to the specified file(s).

For example, if you want to append the output of a command to a file called "output.txt", you can use the following command:

```
command | tee -a output.txt
```

This will execute the command and append its output to "output.txt", while also displaying it on the terminal.
