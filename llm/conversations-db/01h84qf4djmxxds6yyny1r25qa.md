**Prompt:**
Lets think it through carefully and reason it through thoroughly. Write a simple algorithm to perform 5x5 digit multiplication

**Response:**
Algorithm to perform 5x5 digit multiplication:

Step 1: Start
Step 2: Read or input two 5-digit numbers
Step 3: Multiply the two five-digit numbers using the standard multiplication algorithm used in mathematics (multiplication of each digit in the first number with each digit in the second number, followed by addition of the results)
a) To multiply two digit, multiply ones place of both number 
     (e.g. for numbers 12345 x 56789, multiply 5x9)
b) Shift to the next place in the second number, and multiply by every digit of the first number, add the carry from the previous step if any (5x8 adding the carry from previous step)
c) Repeat step 3(b) and move from right to left in the second number and from left to right, in the first number
d) Finally, sum all the rows.
Step 4: Display the multiplication result of the two five-digit numbers
Step 5: Stop
To make this into a full software function or script you would be validity checks for input and error handling that you normally do when developing software. It might also be helpful to have the numbers input as strings so that you can easily access each digit individually. 

Note: 
- Please remember, this simple algorithm does not take into consideration the handling of "carry" during digit multiplication.
- This algorithm assumes that you know basic multiplication and addition processes
- This algorithm is a very basic and does not take into account efficiency or optimization. For actual multiplication at the machine level, there are other algorithms such as Karatsuba Algorithm, Toomâ€“Cook multiplication, Fourier Transform method, etc.
