**Prompt:**
Write the python tests needed to validate that algorithm

**Response:**
To provide the python tests, I need to know which specific algorithm you're referring to. Please provide the details of the algorithm or the code, you're trying to test. 

However, here is a simple example of how you can write a unittest to check a function that adds two numbers:

```python
import unittest

def add_two_numbers(a, b):
    return a + b

class TestSum(unittest.TestCase):

    def test_sum(self):
        self.assertEqual(add_two_numbers(1, 2), 3, "Should be 3")

    def test_sum_negative(self):
        self.assertEqual(add_two_numbers(-1, 1), 0, "Should be 0")
        
    def test_sum_float(self):
        self.assertEqual(add_two_numbers(1.0, 1.5), 2.5, "Should be 2.5")

if __name__ == '__main__':
    unittest.main()
```

In this code:

1. A class `TestSum` is defined which inherits from `unittest.TestCase`.
2. Within the class, several test methods are defined â€“each tests different scenarios.
3. The `assertEqual()` function is used to assert that an expected result and an actual result are equal. If they are not, the test fails.
4. The string right after the condition is the message displayed when the test fails.
5. The final two lines allow us to run all the tests just by running the file.
