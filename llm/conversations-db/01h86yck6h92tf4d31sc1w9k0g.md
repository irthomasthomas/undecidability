**Prompt:**
Can you improve the following text. Add the name of the lead member of the Anandamide team, and add any other important discoveries or ideas from his team about appetite, or anything else: Dedication to Raphael Mechoulam, who discovered the THC molecule with his team at Jerusalem university. Mechoulam and his team also isolated the endogenous version, Anandamide (Bliss Molecule), the version of the THC molecule that humans and mammals produce naturally. And who discovered and mapped the Human Endocannabinoid system. the role of the cannabis system in regulating appetite. Instead of a single chemical, followed up with another single chemical to counter some side affect, and them maybe another, and another until you become a pharmaceutical Rube Goldberg. In the future, computers may analyse your chemical constitution and mix some elixir with the perfect blend of lead role chemicals, and the optimal addition of entourage chemicals, who clear a path and smooth the way for main guys, or clean up the mess in their wake.

**Response:**
Honoring Raphael Mechoulam, the lead member of the renowned Anandamide team, who with his team at Jerusalem University, discovered the Tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) molecule. This ground-breaking research didn't just stop there. Mechoulam and his capable team later isolated the endogenous variant of THC, known as Anandamide or the "Bliss Molecule," which is naturally produced by humans and mammals alike.

This team was also behind the discovery and mapping of the human Endocannabinoid system, a major breakthrough in understanding the integral role it plays in regulating appetite. This complex system operates on a granular level, functioning on more than just a binary chemical system. Gone may soon be the days of using one chemical after another to counteract various side effects, in an almost pharmaceutical iteration of a Rube Goldberg machine.

The team's profound research opens the window to a future where computer analytics may carefully examine an individual's chemical makeup. This would allow for the creation of a personalized elixir, meticulously composed of primary chemicals and optimally supplemented with beneficial ancillary chemicals. These additional "entourage" chemicals aid in navigating and enabling the main players, both enhancing their effectiveness and seamlessly mitigating any residual impact. Anandamide team's cutting-edge findings have the potential to revolutionize the field of medicine, shifting the paradigm of treatment methodologies to a more streamlined and effective approach.
