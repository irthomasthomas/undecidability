**Prompt:**
Rewrite and expand the following to include other facts about his research and ideas. But keep the writing very dry and factual for now, as this is more about his discoveries than the man: Dedication to Raphael Mechoulam, who discovered the THC molecule with his team at Jerusalem university. Mechoulam and his team also isolated the endogenous version, Anandamide (Bliss Molecule), the version of the THC molecule that humans and mammals produce naturally. And who discovered and mapped the Human Endocannabinoid system. the role of the cannabis system in regulating appetite. Instead of a single chemical, followed up with another single chemical to counter some side affect, and them maybe another, and another until you become a pharmaceutical Rube Goldberg. In the future, computers may analyse your chemical constitution and mix some elixir with the perfect blend of lead role chemicals, and the optimal addition of entourage chemicals, who clear a path and smooth the way for main guys, or clean up the mess in their wake.

**Response:**
Raphael Mechoulam, a renowned scientist, is credited with the discovery of the THC molecule, a significant achievement he accomplished with his team at Jerusalem University. Mechoulam's research did not stop there; he and his team also isolated the endogenous version of the THC molecule, Anandamide, also known as the Bliss Molecule. This is the version of the THC molecule that is naturally produced by humans and mammals.

Mechoulam's groundbreaking work extended to the discovery and mapping of the Human Endocannabinoid system. His research revealed the crucial role of the cannabis system in regulating appetite, an insight that has significant implications for understanding human health and disease.

Mechoulam's approach to research deviated from the traditional model of focusing on a single chemical, then adding another to counter any side effects, and so on, in a seemingly endless cycle that could be likened to a pharmaceutical Rube Goldberg machine. Instead, Mechoulam's work suggests a future where computers could analyse an individual's chemical constitution and concoct an elixir tailored to their unique needs.

This elixir would not only contain lead role chemicals but also an optimal blend of entourage chemicals. These entourage chemicals would either pave the way for the main chemicals, ensuring their effective delivery, or clean up any residual mess in their wake. This approach could revolutionize the way we understand and approach pharmaceuticals, moving away from a one-size-fits-all model to a more personalized and efficient system.
