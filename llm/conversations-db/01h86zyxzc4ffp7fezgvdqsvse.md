**Prompt:**
Write a script that plays a notification sound and displays a word on the screen using the graphical system. The word should be very large, taking up most of the screen space. The text should appear in front of any windows etc and have a transparent background. It should appear for 2 seconds only. You can pop the word from head of $HOME/words-list, then add back to the tail. Then sleep for 2 minutes and loop again


**Response:**
```bash
#!/bin/bash

# Function to display word
display_word() {
    word=$(head -n 1 $HOME/words-list)  # Get the first word from the list
    echo $word | osd_cat -d 2 -p middle -A center -f "-*-helvetica-*-r-*-*-720-*-*-*-*-*-*" -O 1 -c white -b none  # Display the word
    sed -i '1d' $HOME/words-list  # Remove the word from the top of the list
    echo $word >> $HOME/words-list  # Add the word back to the end of the list
}

# Function to play notification sound
play_sound() {
    paplay /usr/share/sounds/freedesktop/stereo/message.oga  # Play the sound
}

# Main loop
while true; do
    play_sound
    display_word
    sleep 120  # Sleep for 2 minutes
done
```
This script uses the `osd_cat` command from the `xosd-bin` package to display the word on the screen. The `-d` option specifies the duration for which the word should be displayed, `-p` and `-A` options specify the position and alignment of the word, `-f` option specifies the font and size of the word, `-O` option specifies the outline offset of the word, `-c` option specifies the color of the word, and `-b` option specifies the background of the word.

The `paplay` command is used to play the notification sound. The sound file path may need to be adjusted depending on the system.

The `sed` command is used to remove the first line (the word) from the words list file, and `echo` command is used to append the word back to the end of the file.

The script then sleeps for 2 minutes before repeating the process.
