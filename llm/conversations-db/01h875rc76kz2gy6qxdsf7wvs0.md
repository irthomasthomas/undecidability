**Prompt:**
What is the exact zsh command to: sanitize a command string in bash so that passing it does not execute or derefence any variables?

**Response:**
To sanitize a command string in zsh so that it does not execute or dereference any variables, you can use the `quote` function. Here is the command:

```zsh
quote <command_string>
```

Replace `<command_string>` with the actual command string you want to sanitize. The `quote` function will escape any special characters and prevent variable expansion in the command string.
