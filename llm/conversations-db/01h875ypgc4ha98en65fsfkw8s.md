**Prompt:**
What is the exact zsh command to: how can i escape special characters and prevent variable expansion in the command string.?

**Response:**
To escape special characters and prevent variable expansion in a command string in zsh, you can use single quotes ('') around the command string. Here is an example:

```zsh
command_string='echo $HOME'
echo $command_string
```

In the above example, the variable `$HOME` will not be expanded because it is enclosed in single quotes. The output will be the literal string `$HOME`.
