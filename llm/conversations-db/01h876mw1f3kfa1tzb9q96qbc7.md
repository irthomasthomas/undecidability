**Prompt:**
What is the exact zsh command to: how can i sanatize a string for bash, to escape special characters and prevent variable expansion in the command string in bash that contains a mix of nested quotes and backticks etc?

**Response:**
To sanitize a string in zsh and prevent variable expansion, you can use the `quote` function. Here's the command:

```zsh
quote() {
  print -r -- ${(q)1}
}
```

To use it, simply pass your string as an argument to the `quote` function. For example:

```zsh
quote "This is a string with special characters: $var and \`backticks\`"
```

This will output the sanitized string with all special characters escaped and variable expansion prevented.
