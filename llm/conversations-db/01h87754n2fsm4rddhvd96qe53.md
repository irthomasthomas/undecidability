**Prompt:**
What is the exact zsh command to: scroll the long result in the terminal only session on linux?

**Response:**
To scroll through the long result in the terminal session on Linux using zsh, you can use the `less` command. Here's the exact command:

```
<command> | less
```

Replace `<command>` with the actual command you want to run. This will pipe the output of the command to `less`, which allows you to scroll through the result using the arrow keys or the Page Up and Page Down keys.
