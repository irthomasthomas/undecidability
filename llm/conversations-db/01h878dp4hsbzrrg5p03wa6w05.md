**Prompt:**
Error: Cant open dispray: (null)

**Response:**
The error message suggests that there is an issue with the display. Since you mentioned that you are in a terminal-only session, it is likely that the system doesn't have access to a graphical display to use the xclip command.

If you want to copy the contents of a variable to the clipboard in a terminal-only session, you can use the `xsel` command instead. Here's the modified command:

echo "$1" | xsel --clipboard

This command pipes the contents of the variable `$1` to `xsel`, which is a command-line tool for manipulating the X selection. The `--clipboard` option specifies that the data should be copied to the clipboard.

Make sure you have `xsel` installed on your system before trying this command. You can install it by running `sudo apt-get install xsel` on Debian-based systems or using the package manager of your distribution.

**Prompt:**
How can I check if running display session or terminal only?

**Response:**
You can check if you are running a display session or a terminal-only session by examining the value of the `DISPLAY` environment variable. 

In a display session, the value of `DISPLAY` will usually be something like ":0" or "localhost:0". On the other hand, in a terminal-only session, the `DISPLAY` variable will be empty or unset.

To check the value of the `DISPLAY` variable, you can use the `echo` command:

echo $DISPLAY

The command will output the current value of the `DISPLAY` variable. If it is empty or unset, then it indicates that you are in a terminal-only session.

Alternatively, you can use the `set` command to list all the environment variables and search for the `DISPLAY` variable:

set | grep DISPLAY

This command will display any lines containing the word "DISPLAY", showing its current value. If there is no output, it means that the `DISPLAY` variable is not set, indicating a terminal-only session.
