**Prompt:**
explain: sed -i 's/xclip -selection clipboard/xsel -b/g' /home/tommy/Development/scripts/shell_functions.sh

**Response:**
This command is composed of the `sed` command and a filepath.

`sed` is a stream editor for filtering and transforming text, often used for find and replace functionality in a text file.

`-i` is an option which means that changes are done directly on the file.

The `'s/xclip -selection clipboard/xsel -b/g'` is the actual command that is sent to `sed` . The `s` character signifies that a substitution command is being performed. The substitution is defined by the text that comes after the `s`, separated by slashes. In this case, `xclip -selection clipboard` is being replaced by `xsel -b`.

So, the command as a whole says "In the file `/home/tommy/Development/scripts/shell_functions.sh`, directly replace all instances of `xclip -selection clipboard` with `xsel -b`."

**Prompt:**
Does xsel -b do the same as the command it replaces?

**Response:**
Yes, `xsel -b` and `xclip -selection clipboard` both perform similar actions. They are used for manipulating the system clipboard on Unix-like systems.

`xclip -selection clipboard` and `xsel -b` both copy content to the clipboard that is used in graphical environment (like Ctrl+C/Ctrl+V clipboard).

So, in a way, the `sed` command you used is swapping out `xclip` with `xsel` while maintaining the same functionality. Any commands in `shell_functions.sh` that were using `xclip` to copy to the clipboard will now use `xsel`.
