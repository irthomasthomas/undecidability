**Prompt:**
xsel: cant open display (null)

**Response:**
This error message typically displays when you're trying to use a tool like xsel (which needs to interact with your X server) from a context where the DISPLAY environment variable isn't set. This can happen, for example, if you're trying to use xsel from a cron job, or via SSH without X forwarding enabled.

One possible quick fix, if you're really working from a graphical environment, is to set the DISPLAY environment variable explicitly:

```
export DISPLAY=:0
```

If you're not actually working from a graphical console, then you'll need to use a different tool or approach that doesn't require interaction with an X server. 

If you're working via SSH, you should make sure that X forwarding is enabled. You can enable X forwarding by using the -X flag when initiating your SSH connection:

```
ssh -X user@host
```

Alternatively, check across your SSH configuration for disabled X11 Forwarding. If it is disabled, modify the value on ssh config file by changing the line "X11Forwarding no" to read "X11Forwarding yes." 

Remember to restart your ssh session for the above changes to take effect.

**Prompt:**
I dont run a display session. Is there an equivalent of using clipboard

**Response:**
Since you are not running a display session, your application cannot interact with the clipboard through xsel or xclip. However, you can use a CLI (command-line interface) clipboard tool that does not depend on X Display. There are few utilities like `pbcopy` primarily for macOS and `wl-copy` for Wayland.

If your machine is a server not running any display environment, you could use an utility like `screen` or `tmux` to maintain persistent sessions and their built-in buffers which are similar to manipulating clipboard. 

Nonetheless, note that server-side clipboards won't be accessible from your local machine or another server. Clipboard operation inherently requires a graphical environment. If you have a clipboard on a remote server that you'd like to use locally, then the best approach is to use a network clipboard, but generally those are not secure for transmitting sensitive data.

**Prompt:**
Can I just write a function that uses variables instead of a clipboard

**Response:**
Yes, absolutely. For scripts or functions running inside the same shell or application, using variables is a common and highly effective way to store and pass along data. Here's a simple example:

```bash
function copy_and_paste() {
    copied_data=$1
    # Do something with $copied_data
    echo "Pasted data: $copied_data"
}

# Use the function
copy_and_paste "Hello, World!"
```

If you're working across different scripts or processes, you might need to use temporary files or another inter-process communication technique instead. It's all a matter of what's most appropriate for your specific use case.

**Prompt:**
Write a complete and robust function to copy, and a seperate function to paste

**Response:**
Based on your requirements, I am providing a simple bash function implementation for "copying"(store) and "pasting" (retrieve) data using temporary files as kind of a "clipboard". This might help you get started. You're going to want to customize this to better fit your needs, of course!

```bash
# Function to 'copy' data
copy() {
  if [ $# -eq 0 ]; then
    echo "No arguments provided to copy."
    return 1
  fi

  echo $1 > /tmp/clipboard
  return 0
}

# Function to 'paste' data
paste() {
  if [ ! -f /tmp/clipboard ]; then
    echo "Nothing to paste."
    return 1
  fi

  cat /tmp/clipboard
  return 0
}
```

Here's how you can use it:

```bash
# 'Copy' data.
copy "Hello, World!"

# 'Paste' data.
paste
```

Remember, this is a very simple implementation and only allows for 'copying' one string at a time (the last copied string). If 'copy' is called again, it will overwrite the old 'copied' string. It doesn't handle copying of file content but only simple strings. Also, keep in mind that `/tmp` data could be deleted on reboot or at any time depending on the system configuration. Plus, this won't persist across different terminal sessions. 

For handling more complex needs, you might have to either adapt this approach considerably or use a different technique.
