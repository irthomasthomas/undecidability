**Prompt:**
What is the exact zsh command to: how can i copy a string in a terminal without a display session??

**Response:**
To copy a string in a terminal without a display session, you can use the `xclip` command. First, make sure you have `xclip` installed on your system. If not, you can install it using the package manager of your Linux distribution.

Once `xclip` is installed, you can use the following command to copy a string to the clipboard:

```shell
echo "your_string" | xclip -selection clipboard
```

Replace "your_string" with the actual string you want to copy. After running this command, the string will be copied to the clipboard and can be pasted using the usual paste command (e.g., Ctrl+V).

Note: This command assumes you are using X11 as your display server. If you are using Wayland or another display server, you may need to use a different command or tool for clipboard management.
