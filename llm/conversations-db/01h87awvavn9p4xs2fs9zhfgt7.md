**Prompt:**
What is the exact zsh command to: how can i copy a string in a terminal without a display session??

**Response:**
To copy a string in a terminal without a display session, you can use the `xclip` command. First, make sure you have `xclip` installed on your system. If not, you can install it using the package manager of your Linux distribution.

Once `xclip` is installed, you can use the following command to copy a string to the clipboard:

```shell
echo "your_string" | xclip -selection clipboard
```

Replace "your_string" with the actual string you want to copy. After running this command, the string will be copied to the clipboard and can be pasted using the usual paste command (e.g., Ctrl+V).

Note: This command assumes you are using X11 as your display server. If you are using Wayland or another display server, you may need to use a different command or tool for clipboard management.

**Prompt:**
thought xclip dont work without display session

**Response:**
You're correct. `xclip` requires a display session to function properly. If you're running a terminal in a non-graphical environment or without a display session, you can use `tmux` or `screen` to create a virtual terminal with a display session.

Here's an example using `tmux`:

1. Install `tmux` if you don't have it already installed.

2. Start a `tmux` session by running the following command:
```shell
tmux new-session -s clipboard
```

3. Within the `tmux` session, run the following command to copy the string to the clipboard:
```shell
echo "your_string" | xclip -selection clipboard
```

4. Detach from the `tmux` session by pressing `Ctrl+b` and then `d`. This will return you to the regular terminal.

5. You can now close your original terminal or open a new one without a display session.

6. When you need to paste the copied string, reattach to the `tmux` session by running the following command:
```shell
tmux attach-session -t clipboard
```
Then, you can paste the copied string using the usual paste command (e.g., right-click and select "Paste" or use the paste keyboard shortcut).

This way, you can copy a string in a terminal without a display session by using `tmux` to create a virtual terminal with a display session.
