**Prompt:**
What is the exact zsh command to: how can i display part of a string I am interested in?


**Response:**
To display part of a string in zsh, you can use the parameter expansion feature. Here's the command:

```shell
echo ${string:start:length}
```

Replace `string` with the actual string you want to extract from, `start` with the starting index of the substring, and `length` with the number of characters you want to extract.

For example, if you have a string "Hello World" and you want to display only the word "World", you can use the following command:

```shell
echo ${"Hello World":6:5}
```

This will output "World".

**Prompt:**
I dont know the possition yet

**Response:**
If you don't know the position of the substring you want to extract, you can use pattern matching in zsh. Here's the command to display the part of the string you are interested in:

```shell
echo ${(M)string#pattern}
```

Replace `string` with the actual string you want to search in, and `pattern` with the specific pattern you want to match.

For example, if you have a string "Hello World" and you want to display only the word "World", you can use the following command:

```shell
echo ${(M)"Hello World"#* }
```

This will output "World" by matching the pattern `* ` (space followed by any characters) and removing it from the string.
