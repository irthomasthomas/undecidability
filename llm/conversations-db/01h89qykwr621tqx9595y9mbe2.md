**Prompt:**
usage and guide for popd shell built-in

**Response:**
`popd` is a command used in Unix-like operating systems to remove directories from the directory stack, which is stored in the `DIRSTACK` shell variable. This stack is used in conjunction with commands like `pushd` and `dirs` to change, view, and navigate between directories from the command line. 

Here is a quick guide of how to use it:

- The basic usage is `popd`. Used without any arguments, it removes the top directory from the stack and changes the current working directory to the new top directory on the stack. Essentially, it can be used to return back to the most recent directory that was added to the stack with `pushd`.

- `popd -n` or `popd +n`: This form of command removes the nth directory from the stack, counting from the left of the list shown by `dirs`, starting with zero. 

- If the `popd` command is successful, it returns 0(true). Otherwise, it returns 1(false).

Example:

Suppose you are currently in the `/home/user/documents` directory and you switch to the `/var/tmp` directory using the `pushd` command:

```bash
$ pushd /var/tmp
```

Now, if you use `popd`, you will return to the `/home/user/documents` directory:

```bash
$ popd
```

Note:

- `pushd`, `popd`, and `dirs` are built-in commands of bash shell. They might not be available or work differently in other shells.
- These commands are very handy for moving back and forth between directories in a command line environment.
- You can use `dirs` command to display the list of currently stacked directories.
- The `pushd` command without any arguments swaps the top two directories.
