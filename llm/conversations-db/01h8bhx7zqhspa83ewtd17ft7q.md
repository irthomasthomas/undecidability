**Prompt:**
is the output still in some variable maybe?

**Response:**
No, by default, the output of the last curl request is not stored in a variable. The output is directly printed to the terminal.

However, you can capture the output in a variable by using command substitution with `$()` or backticks. For example:

```shell
result=$(curl https://example.com)
```

In this case, the output of the curl command will be stored in the `result` variable.
