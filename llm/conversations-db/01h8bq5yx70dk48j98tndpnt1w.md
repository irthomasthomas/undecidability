**Response:**
This command uses `grep` which is a Linux/Unix command-line utility for searching text content or files for lines that contain a match to a specified pattern. 

Here's a breakdown of the command options:

- `-r` or `--recursive`: This option makes the command search files recursively in all sub-directories.

- `-P` or `--perl-regexp`: Interprets the pattern as a Perl regular expression. This is a powerful feature that lets you create more complex search patterns.

- `-z` or `--null`: Treats the input as a set of lines, each terminated by a zero byte (the ASCII 'NUL' character) instead of a newline. This is useful when you want to search in binary files like `*.json`.

- `-o` or `--only-matching`: This will show only the part of a matching line that matches the pattern.

- `(?s)`: This is a Perl regular expression flag that enables 'single-line' mode. In this mode, the `.` special character can match a newline character.

- `\{[^}]*?your_string[^}]*?\}`: This is the actual pattern the command is searching for. It tries to match any json object (denoted by the `{}` brackets) that contains 'your_string'.

- `.`: This stands for the current directory. You can replace this with the directory path where you want to search.
