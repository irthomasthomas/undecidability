**Prompt:**
'grep -r -Pzo '(?s){[^}]*?git[^}]*?}' Search/pdf-to-text.text | jq 
 parse error: Invalid numeric literal at line 1, column 478' 

**Response:**
The command you're trying to run is a combination of `grep` and `jq`, used to search for specific patterns in a text file and format json data respectively.

Here's a breakdown:

The `grep -r -Pzo '(?s){[^}]*?git[^}]*?}' Search/pdf-to-text.text` part of the command uses grep to search for text between curly braces ({}) that contain the word 'git' in your 'pdf-to-text.text' file in the 'Search' directory. 

The `| jq` part of the command is supposed to format the output as a JSON.

The error you're encountering says: `parse error: Invalid numeric literal at line 1, column 478`. This implies that there's something wrong in the first line and 478th column of your data.

Based on the error message, it's likely that `jq` is encountering a problem while trying to parse the output from your `grep` command. The `grep` command is probably returning some text that `jq` can't parse into JSON.

You can try to run the grep command separately `grep -r -Pzo '(?s){[^}]*?git[^}]*?}' Search/pdf-to-text.text` to see what it's returning. 

If it's still unclear what's causing the issue, please provide some of the entries from the file you are searching through. It's hard to debug without the exact data causing the issue. Keep in mind to provide non-sensitive data, since this is a public platform. 

Another thing to consider, the grep command with `-Pzo` uses Perl-compatible regex to search for multiline matches. If your Perl version doesn't support this, this might cause issues too.

**Response:**
The issue arises from the fact that the `grep` command returns more than a single JSON object. Basically, the grep output is not a valid JSON array or object but multiple JSON Objects. The `jq` command is expecting a single valid JSON object or a JSON array and is unable to handle the output given, hence why it's returning a parse error.

To resolve this, you can modify your command into a loop for each matched JSON object you've found with `grep`. See the example below:

```bash
grep -r -Pzo '(?s){[^}]*?git[^}]*?}' Search/pdf-to-text.text | 
while IFS= read -r line; do
    echo "$line" | jq .;
done
```

In this command, `while IFS= read -r line` will read each json found by `grep` command. Then for each line (basically each json object string), it will be passed into `jq` command for parsing. That way, `jq` will handle each json object, one at a time.

Another approach, if your json objects are separated by `%` as per your `grep` output, would be to `-d` option to specify delimiter for jq.

```bash
grep -r -Pzo '(?s){[^}]*?git[^}]*?}' Search/pdf-to-text.text | tr "%" "\n" | jq -c '.'
```

Here we are replacing the `%` with new line and `-c` option combines all the valid JSON records into one line.  

Be aware that this will only work if each `%` sign correctly delimits a fully formed JSON object and every newline is a part of JSON object in your `grep` output. If that's not the case, you might still see errors. That's why based upon your `grep` output, the first option of using loop is more reliable as it handles each json object one by one.
