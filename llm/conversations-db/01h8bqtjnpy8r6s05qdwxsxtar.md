**Prompt:**
think carefully for a better way to perform this: \n grep -r -Pzo '(?s){[^}]*?git[^}]*?}' Search/pdf-to-text.text | 
while IFS= read -r line; do
    echo "$line" | jq .;
done

**Response:**
One possible way to optimize this command is to eliminate the while loop and use jq's --slurp option to read the input as a single JSON array. Here's an updated version of the command:

```bash
grep -r -Pzo '(?s){[^}]*?git[^}]*?}' Search/pdf-to-text.text | jq --slurp .
```

This will search for the pattern specified by the regex in the `Search/pdf-to-text.text` file, and then pass the output to jq to format it as JSON. The `--slurp` option reads the entire input as a single JSON array, which can be more efficient and avoids the need for a loop.
