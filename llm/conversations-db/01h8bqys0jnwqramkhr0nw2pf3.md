**Prompt:**
think carefully for a way to optimize this command for multiple json objects returned by grep: \n grep -r -Pzo '(?s){[^}]*?git[^}]*?}' Search/pdf-to-text.text | 
while IFS= read -r line; do
    echo "$line" | jq .;
done

**Response:**
One way to optimize this command for multiple JSON objects returned by grep is to use the `-l` option with grep instead of `-o`. This will output only the file names that contain matches, and then you can pass those file names to `jq` to process the JSON objects.

Here's the optimized command:

```
grep -r -Pzl '(?s){[^}]*?git[^}]*?}' Search/pdf-to-text.text | xargs -I{} jq . {}
```

Explanation:
- The `-l` option with grep tells it to output only the file names of matching files.
- The `-z` option is used to handle newline characters in the file names.
- The `xargs` command is used to pass the file names to `jq` as arguments.
- The `{}` placeholder is used to specify the position for the file name in the `jq` command.

This way, grep will find all the files that contain the desired pattern, and `jq` will then process each file individually and print the JSON objects.

Note: Make sure to replace `Search/pdf-to-text.text` with the appropriate file or pattern you want to search.
