**Prompt:**
Think carefully. On linux, use jq, contains, and select tools to return the json objects that contain the string: github, from pdf-to-text.text: cat /home/tommy/Search/pdf-to-text.text

**Response:**
To return the JSON objects containing the string "github" from the file "pdf-to-text.text" using Linux commands (jq, contains, and select), follow these steps:

1. Open the terminal on your Linux system.
2. Use the following command to search for the string "github" in the JSON file and return the matching objects:
```
cat /home/tommy/Search/pdf-to-text.text | jq 'select(. | contains("github"))'
```
Make sure to replace "/home/tommy/Search/pdf-to-text.text" with the actual path to your "pdf-to-text.text" file.

This command uses the `cat` command to read the content of the file, pipes it to `jq` for JSON processing, and then uses `select` to filter the JSON objects containing the string "github".

Executing the command should display the JSON objects that match the search criteria in your terminal.
