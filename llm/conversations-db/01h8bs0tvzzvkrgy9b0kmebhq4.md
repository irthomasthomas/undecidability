**Prompt:**
Think carefully. On linux, use jq, contains, and select tools to return the json objects that contain the string: github, from pdf-to-text.text: cat /home/tommy/Search/pdf-to-text.text

**Response:**
To achieve this, you can use the following command in Linux:

```bash
cat /home/tommy/Search/pdf-to-text.text | jq -c 'select(.text | contains("github")ï¼‰'
```

Let me break it down for you:

1. `cat /home/tommy/Search/pdf-to-text.text`: This command is used to display the content of the 'pdf-to-text.text' file. Adjust the file path as per your actual file location.

2. `jq -c 'select(.text | contains("github"))'`: It uses `jq` to process the JSON data and filters the objects that contain the string "github". The `-c` flag ensures that each matched object is output as a single line.

Make sure you have `jq` installed on your Linux system before running this command.
