**Prompt:**
What is the exact zsh command to: a version of select that ignores case?


**Response:**
There is no built-in option in zsh's `select` command to ignore case. However, you can achieve a case-insensitive behavior by using a combination of `typeset` and `case` statement. Here's an example:

```zsh
typeset -l choice
select choice in option1 option2 option3; do
    case $choice in
        option1) echo "You selected Option 1"; break ;;
        option2) echo "You selected Option 2"; break ;;
        option3) echo "You selected Option 3"; break ;;
        *) echo "Invalid choice. Please try again." ;;
    esac
done
```

In the above example, `typeset -l choice` sets the `choice` variable to lowercase, making it case-insensitive. The `case` statement then checks the lowercase value of `choice` to perform the desired action.
