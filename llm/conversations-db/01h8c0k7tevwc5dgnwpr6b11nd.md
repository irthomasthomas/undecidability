**Prompt:**
explain | jq '.data[] | select(.title | contains("Git"))'  

**Response:**
This `jq` command is using `select` to filter out objects from an input JSON file or stream. 

The input JSON is expected to have a structure where there is a `data` array that contains multiple objects. The `jq` command will iterate over each object in the `data` array.

For each object in the `data` array, the `select` filter is applied. The `select` filter is checking if the `title` field of the object contains the string "Git". 

If the `title` field contains "Git", then that object will be selected and outputted by the command.
