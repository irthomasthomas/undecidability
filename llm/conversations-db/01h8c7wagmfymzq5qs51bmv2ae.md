**Prompt:**
think carefully. In manjaro/arch linux. I want to store the output of every bash and zsh command in addition to the normal input history. If the len of a command output is greater than 2000, compress the text

**Response:**
You can achieve this functionality using `script` command in Linux and a few scripts. However, this would be nontrivial to implement.

**Step 1:** Add the following simple bash function in your `.bashrc` or `.zshrc` profile.

```bash
cmdlog() {
    script -q -c "$@" /dev/null
}
```

The `script` command will start to make a typescript of the current terminal session, logging the command executed (`-c "$@"`) as well as its output. The `-q` option makes `script` silent during the logging. `/dev/null` discards the typescript file.

**Step 2:** Create a PROMPT_COMMAND function.

`PROMPT_COMMAND` execute the function just before issuing the next prompt.

```bash
export PROMPT_COMMAND=cmdlog
```

**Step 3:** Write the history to log file using standard history built-in command.

```bash
history -a >> ./bash_history_log
```

**Step 4:** Write a script to compress the log text if the length is greater than 2000.

```bash
filepath='./bash_history_log'
maxlen=2000
filelen=$(wc -c <"$filepath")

if (( filelen > maxlen )); then
    gzip "$filepath"
fi
```

**Step 5:** Add the compression script in to `.bashrc` or `.zshrc` or cronjob, or systemd service to regularly check the length of `bash_history_log` and compress it if it is too long.

Remember it's very hard to customize bash or zsh to fulfill your requirements directly. For the time-related logging, it's also a bit tricky for bash or zsh. `PROMPT_COMMAND` cannot save the command start and end time.

Note: Keep in mind that this could potentially fill your hard drive up very quickly depending on the work you are doing. Use this at your own risk.

Also, store outputs should be authorized especially when data is sensitive or the amount of data is huge because it could potentially break the system if the disk space isn't big enough.
Be sure to always get permission before implementing such a system especially in a professional setting.
