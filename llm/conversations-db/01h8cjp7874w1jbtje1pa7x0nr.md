**Prompt:**
What is the exact zsh command to: think carefully. Explain this command: [[ -z "$RECORDING_ON" ]] || source /home/tommy/Development/scripts/session-recorder.sh?


**Response:**
The exact zsh command is:

```shell
[[ -z "$RECORDING_ON" ]] || source /home/tommy/Development/scripts/session-recorder.sh
```

Explanation:
- `[[ -z "$RECORDING_ON" ]]` checks if the variable `RECORDING_ON` is empty or unset.
- `||` is the logical OR operator in zsh.
- `source /home/tommy/Development/scripts/session-recorder.sh` is the command to source (execute) the script file `/home/tommy/Development/scripts/session-recorder.sh`.

So, the command checks if the variable `RECORDING_ON` is empty or unset. If it is, the command does nothing. If it is not empty or unset, it sources (executes) the script file `/home/tommy/Development/scripts/session-recorder.sh`.
