**Prompt:**
think it through carefully. Ok, lets work this out. List all the ways of launching an installed application from the terminal in KDE on Manjaro linux, using the apps .desktop file stored. We do not want to edit or open directly the .desktop file, but the destination or target of the .desktop file.

**Response:**
To launch an installed application from the terminal in KDE on Manjaro Linux using the .desktop file, you can follow these steps:

1. Open a terminal emulator.
2. Determine the name of the .desktop file for the application you want to launch. You can list the contents of the `/usr/share/applications/` directory to find the available .desktop files:

   ```
   ls /usr/share/applications/
   ```

3. Once you have determined the .desktop file you want to use, you can launch the application by using the `xdg-open` command followed by the path to the .desktop file. For example, if the .desktop file is named `example.desktop`, you would use the following command:

   ```
   xdg-open /usr/share/applications/example.desktop
   ```

   This will open the default associated application for the .desktop file, which should be the destination or target application.

4. If you want to run the application in the terminal, you can use the `Exec` line from the .desktop file directly. To extract the executable command, you can use the `grep` command to search for the `Exec=` line and then use `awk` to extract the command:

   ```
   grep "^Exec=" /usr/share/applications/example.desktop | awk -F "=" '{print $2}' | awk '{print $1}'
   ```

   Replace `example.desktop` with the actual .desktop filename. This will print the executable command from the .desktop file, and you can then run it in the terminal:

   ```
   /path/to/executable
   ```

   Replace `/path/to/executable` with the actual path obtained from the previous command.

Note: Keep in mind that the commands provided assume standard paths and conventions in Manjaro Linux. If your system has customized paths or configurations, you may need to adjust accordingly.
