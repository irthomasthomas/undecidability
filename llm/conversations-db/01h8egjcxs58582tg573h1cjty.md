**Prompt:**
think it through carefully. Ok, lets work this out. Write a list with a brief exapmle of all of the ways  of launching an installed application from the terminal in KDE on Manjaro linux, using the apps .desktop file stored, appart from xdg-open.

**Response:**
Sure, here is a list of various ways to launch an installed application from the terminal in KDE on Manjaro Linux, using the application's .desktop file stored, apart from using xdg-open:

1. Using the `kstart` command:
   Example: `kstart --windowclass <ApplicationName>`

2. Using the `kde-open` command:
   Example: `kde-open <PathToApplication.desktop>`

3. Using the `kioclient` command:
   Example: `kioclient exec <PathToApplication.desktop>`

4. Using the `kf5-kglobalaccel` command:
   Example: `kf5-kglobalaccel exec <PathToApplication.desktop>`

5. Using the `klauncher` command:
   Example: `klauncher --launch <ApplicationName>`

It's worth noting that the specific names and paths used in the examples may vary based on your Manjaro Linux setup and the application you're trying to launch. Please replace `<ApplicationName>` with the actual name of the application and `<PathToApplication.desktop>` with the correct file path of the .desktop file for that application on your system.
