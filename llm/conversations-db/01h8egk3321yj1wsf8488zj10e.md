**Prompt:**
think it through carefully. Ok, lets work this out. Write a list with a brief exapmle of all of the ways  of launching an installed application from the terminal in Manjaro linux, using the apps .desktop file stored, appart from xdg-open.

**Response:**
Here is a list of various methods to launch an installed application from the terminal in Manjaro Linux, using the .desktop file apart from xdg-open:

1. Using the "Exec" command:
   - Open the terminal and navigate to the directory where the .desktop file is stored.
   - Open the .desktop file using a text editor (e.g., nano, gedit).
   - Look for the "Exec" line and copy the command mentioned after it.
   - Paste the command in the terminal and press Enter to execute it.
   Example: Assuming the command is "firefox %u" in the .desktop file, you would run it as: `firefox %u`

2. Using the "bash" command:
   - Open the terminal and navigate to the directory where the .desktop file is stored.
   - Run the .desktop file directly using the "bash" command.
   Example: Assuming the .desktop file is called "example.desktop", you would run it as: `bash example.desktop`

3. Using the "desktop-file-run" command:
   - Open the terminal and navigate to the directory where the .desktop file is stored.
   - Use the "desktop-file-run" command followed by the path to the .desktop file.
   Example: Assuming the .desktop file is located at "/usr/share/applications/example.desktop", you would run it as: `desktop-file-run /usr/share/applications/example.desktop`

4. Using the "gtk-launch" command:
   - Open the terminal and run the "gtk-launch" command followed by the name of the application mentioned in the .desktop file.
   Example: Assuming the application name is "firefox.desktop", you would run it as: `gtk-launch firefox.desktop`

5. Using the "xdg-desktop-menu" command:
   - Open the terminal and use the "xdg-desktop-menu" command followed by the path to the .desktop file.
   Example: Assuming the .desktop file is located at "/usr/share/applications/example.desktop", you would run it as: `xdg-desktop-menu install /usr/share/applications/example.desktop`

Remember to replace "example.desktop" with the actual name of the .desktop file you want to launch.
