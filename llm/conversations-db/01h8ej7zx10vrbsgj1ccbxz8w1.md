**Prompt:**
Think it through carefully. In zsh or bash, can a registered function be replaced programmatically? E.g. which Mexec_dot_desktop \n exec_dot_desktop () {
	exec_line=$(awk '/Desktop Entry/,0' "$1" | grep -E "^Exec=" | cut -d "=" -f 2-)
	eval $exec_line
}

**Response:**
Yes, a registered function can be replaced programmatically in both zsh and bash. In the given example, the function `exec_dot_desktop` is defined and can be replaced by redefining it with a new implementation. This can be done by simply redefining the function with a new definition in the script or by sourcing a different script that contains the new implementation.

**Prompt:**
the function is defined in .zshrc. I want a way to reliably replace the old function in the file with a new version of the same function

**Response:**
To reliably replace the old function in the `.zshrc` file with a new version of the same function, you can use a technique called function redefinition. Here's a step-by-step approach:

1. Open your `.zshrc` file in a text editor.
2. Locate the section where the function `exec_dot_desktop` is defined.
3. Replace the old implementation of the function with the new implementation.
4. Save the changes and close the file.

After saving the changes, the next time you open a new terminal or start a new zsh session, the new version of the function will be used. Any invocations of the function will execute the updated code.

Note that this approach modifies the `.zshrc` file directly, so be cautious while making changes to ensure that you are updating the correct function definition.

**Prompt:**
the function is defined in .zshrc. I want a way to programmatically replace the old function in the file with a new version of the same function

**Response:**
To programmatically replace the old function in the `.zshrc` file with a new version of the same function, you can use a script that modifies the file. Here's a sample script that achieves this:

```bash
#!/bin/bash

old_function=$(cat ~/.zshrc | awk '/Mexec_dot_desktop/,/^}/')

new_function='Mexec_dot_desktop () {
    new_exec_line=$(awk "/Desktop Entry/,0" "$1" | grep -E "^Exec=" | cut -d "=" -f 2-)
    eval $new_exec_line
}'

sed -i "s|$old_function|$new_function|g" ~/.zshrc
source ~/.zshrc
```
This script:

1. Reads the contents of `.zshrc` and extracts the old function definition using `awk`.
2. Defines the new version of the function, assigning it to the `new_function` variable.
3. Uses `sed` to replace the old function definition with the new one in the `.zshrc` file.
4. Sources the modified `.zshrc` to update the function in the current shell.

Make sure to save this script in a separate file (e.g., `replace_function.sh`), grant it execute permissions (`chmod +x replace_function.sh`), and execute it to replace the old function with the new version in `.zshrc`.
