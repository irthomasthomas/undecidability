**Prompt:**
explain the following bash code:            which() { declare -f | which --read-functions $@ }
           export -f which

**Response:**
The given bash code defines a new function called "which" and exports it.

1. `which() { declare -f | which --read-functions $@ }`
   - This line defines a new function called "which".
   - The function is defined using the syntax `function_name() { command }`.
   - The command in this case is `declare -f | which --read-functions $@`.
   - The `declare -f` command lists all defined functions, and `which --read-functions` reads the function definition from standard input and outputs the corresponding function name. `$@` is a special variable that represents command-line arguments passed to the function.
   - Overall, this line defines a function that, when called, displays the name of the function that called it.

2. `export -f which`
   - This line exports the newly defined function "which".
   - The `export` command makes the function available to any child processes or subshells spawned from the current shell.
   - The `-f` flag indicates that the argument is a function name, and in this case, it is "which".
