**Prompt:**
explain the following bash code:            which() { declare -f | which --read-functions $@ }
           export -f which

**Response:**
The given bash code defines a function called "which" and exports it as a global function.

The function "which" is defined using the syntax "which() { ... }". Inside the function, the "declare -f" command is used to display the definition of all functions currently defined in the shell. The output of this command is then piped (|) to the "which --read-functions" command.

The "which" command is a utility used to locate the executable file associated with a given command. In this case, the "--read-functions" option is used to read function definitions from the input and display the source file and line number where each function is defined.

The "$@" is a special variable in bash that represents all the arguments passed to the function. It is used here to pass any arguments given to the "which" function to the "which --read-functions" command.

Finally, the "export -f which" command is used to export the "which" function as a global function. This means that the function can be accessed and used by other scripts or processes running in the same shell session.
