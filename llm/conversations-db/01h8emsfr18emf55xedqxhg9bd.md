**Prompt:**
Help explain: ‚ùØ which() { declare -f | which --read-functions $@ } && export -f which
export: invalid option(s)

**Response:**
This command is a function definition that some systems use to override the default behavior of the `which` command. Here's a breakdown of what it does:

1. `which()` is the name of the function being defined.
2. `{}` braces are used to enclose the function definition.
3. `declare -f` is a command used to display the function definition.
4. `which --read-functions $@` is the default behavior of the `which` command, where `--read-functions` is an option to read function definitions.
5. `&&` is the logical AND operator.
6. `export -f which` exports the function definition so that it can be used in subshells.

The error message "export: invalid option(s)" indicates that the `-f` option is not recognized by the `export` command on your system. The `-f` option is used to export a function, but it seems that your system's `export` command does not support this option.

It's important to note that the behavior of commands like `declare` and `export` can vary between different shell environments and versions. This command may work on some systems but not on others, depending on the shell and its configuration.
