**Prompt:**
What is the exact zsh command to: escape a dash in grep?


**Response:**
To escape a dash in `grep`, you can use the backslash `\` character before the dash. Here is the exact `zsh` command:

```shell
grep 'text\-with\-dash' file.txt
```

Replace `'text\-with\-dash'` with the actual text you want to search for, and `file.txt` with the name of the file you want to search in.
