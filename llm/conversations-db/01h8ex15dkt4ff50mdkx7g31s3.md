**Prompt:**
escape a dash in grep

**Response:**
To escape a dash in grep, you can use either of the following methods:

1. Use a backslash (\) before the dash:
```
grep "text\-" file.txt
```

2. Use character class notation ([ ]) to enclose the dash:
```
grep "text[-]" file.txt
```

Both methods will ensure that the dash is treated as a literal character and not interpreted as a special character by grep.
