**Prompt:**
Think it through carefully. Guide me interactively through the process of creating a simple bash script to query a search engine website from the terminal. We will have to analayze the web page traffic through chrome dev tools to figure out their private api. We may, or may not need a cookie, or TLS. I will using curl or tls version of curl, or whatever you suggest later

**Response:**
Creating scripts that interact with websites can be tricky and depend on the specific website in question, because different websites are designed differently. In general though, we can outline a high-level process of how to do this. The specific process will need to be tailored to the specific website you want to query. 

**Disclaimer:** Most websites have strict usage policies in their Terms of Service agreements that prohibit scrapers/bots and unauthorized requests. Make sure that your actions are legal and don't violate those terms. 

Here are the abstract steps, which will be followed by an example with a fictional RESTful API:

### Abstract steps

1. Analyzing the web traffic: Open Chrome dev tools (right click on a webpage->Inspect->Network tab). Find the request you need by reloading the web page and checking network logs (search for API endpoints). 

2. Determine the necessary headers (like authorization tokens, or cookies).

3. Craft the curl request: Based on your findings, call the private API using curl or wget.

4. Put it into a shell script: Finally, convert the curl command to a bash script.

### Example 

Suppose we have an API Endpoint: `https://api.example.com/search?q=query`, which sends a GET request and receives a JSON response. This doesn't require any authorization.

Here's how we might craft a bash script for this:

First, open a new file, and add this content:

```bash
#!/bin/bash

# Make sure to replace {query} with your search query
QUERY={query}

# Send the GET request
RESPONSE=$(curl -s -G "https://api.example.com/search" --data-urlencode "q=$QUERY")

# Now RESPONSE contains JSON search results. You can parse it as you want.
# Here we simply print it out
echo $RESPONSE
```

This is a basic search script. 

Remember Endpoint, method, headers and api query params you will to figure out by yourself by web traffic analysis (chrome dev tools).

If you need authorization often API server sets cookie via Set-Cookie response header but sometimes you need to manually grab token from page html/js and stick it to request headers. It's heavily depends on the website.

Also, if api uses outdated version of TLS you may need to specify `--tlsv1.x` (where x is the version of TLS) flag to curl.

Save this content to a file, for example `search.sh`, then run `chmod +x search.sh` in the terminal to make it executable. Now you can run it with `./search.sh`.

Please note, JSON parsing in Bash is very tricky and it's better to either use specialized command-line tools for that or process JSON in a language that has JSON support, Python for example.
