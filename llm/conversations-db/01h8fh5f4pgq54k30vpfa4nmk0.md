**Prompt:**
think about it carefully. Is it possible to install apps on apple iphone X without the app store?

**Response:**
No, it is not possible to install apps on an Apple iPhone X without using the App Store, unless you jailbreak your device, which is not recommended. The App Store is the only authorized platform to download apps on an iPhone. Unauthorized installation could compromise the security of the device and void the device warranty. If you're a developer, you can also sideload apps but for an average user, it's suggested to stick to the App Store.
