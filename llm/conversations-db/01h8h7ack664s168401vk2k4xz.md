The Nielsen Ratings are audience measurement systems operated by Nielsen Media Research, a company that seeks to determine the audience size, preferences, and demographics of various outlets in the media, including broadcast television, cable television, radio, and newspapers. The data collected by Nielsen is used by advertisers, programmers, and broadcasters to understand the preferences of their viewers and listeners, and to guide the content and advertising they produce accordingly. Moreover, data from the Nielsen Ratings is used to determine the price of advertising spots. The more viewers or listeners a show or station has according to the Nielsen Ratings, the higher the cost to advertise during that show or on that station.
