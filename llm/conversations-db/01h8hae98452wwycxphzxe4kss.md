**Prompt:**
Explain: file --mime-type <filename>

**Response:**
The command "file --mime-type <filename>" is used to determine the MIME (Multipurpose Internet Mail Extensions) type of a given file. 

When executed, the "file" command examines the content of the specified file and provides information about the type of data it contains. The "--mime-type" option specifically instructs the command to display only the MIME type.

The MIME type is a standardized way of classifying files based on their nature and format. It is represented as a text string that consists of a type and a subtype, separated by a forward slash (/). For example, the MIME type for a JPEG image is "image/jpeg," while the MIME type for a text file is "text/plain."

By using the "file --mime-type" command, you can easily determine the exact MIME type of a file, which can be useful for various purposes such as identifying the appropriate software or web browser to open the file type, handling file uploads or downloads correctly, or verifying the integrity of a file based on its expected MIME type.
