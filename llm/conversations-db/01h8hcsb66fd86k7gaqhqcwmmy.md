**Prompt:**
An idea for my idodid app. On linux, using KDE Plasma or another lower level system or window manager. Devise a way to record notes against a window. Write an algorithm and prototype bash or similar. Assume Manjaro (Arch) Linux, KDE Plasma, QT5 or QT6. I see two main parts: 1: Storing a note against a window pid. This should be a common pattern. 2: Display the note text somewhere on the screen when the window is activated. Think it through carefully.

**Response:**
To implement a note-taking feature for windows on Linux using KDE Plasma or another lower-level window manager, you can follow these steps:

1. Storing a note against a window PID:
   - Use the `xdotool` command-line tool to get the active window's PID.
   - Store the note text along with the corresponding window PID in a file or a database.
   - You can create a simple text file where each line represents a note with its associated window PID. For example: `note.txt`:
     ```
     1234: This is a note for window with PID 1234
     5678: Another note for window with PID 5678
     ```

2. Displaying the note text when the window is activated:
   - Use the `xdotool` tool again to detect window activation.
   - When a window is activated, retrieve its PID using `xdotool` and check if there is a note stored for that PID.
   - If a note exists, display it somewhere on the screen using a notification system or a custom widget.

Here's a prototype bash script that demonstrates the above steps:

```bash
#!/bin/bash

# Retrieve the active window PID
active_pid=$(xdotool getactivewindow getwindowpid)

# Check if there is a note stored for the active window PID
note=$(grep "^$active_pid:" note.txt | cut -d ':' -f2-)

# Display the note text if it exists
if [[ -n $note ]]; then
    # Display the note using a notification system like `notify-send`
    notify-send "Note for Window ($active_pid)" "$note"
fi
```

Make sure to replace `note.txt` with the actual path to your note storage file.

To automatically trigger this script whenever a window is activated, you can bind it to a KDE Plasma global shortcut or use a window manager-specific event hook.

Note: This is a basic prototype, and you may need to enhance it further based on your specific requirements and the capabilities of your chosen window manager or desktop environment.
