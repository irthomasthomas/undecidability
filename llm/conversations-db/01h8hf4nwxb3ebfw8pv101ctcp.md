**Prompt:**
in kde Plasma 5 on manjaro linux, where is the list of stock icon names?

**Response:**
The list of stock icon names for KDE Plasma 5 on Manjaro Linux is generally not in a specific text file or directory. The icon files themselves are usually located in the `/usr/share/icons` directory.

In KDE Plasma, you can see the names and preview of the icons through the icon settings in the system settings. You can access it through `System Settings ➔ Appearance ➔ Icons`.

To specifically see the icons' names file by file, you have to look into the icons' directories and subfolders in `/usr/share/icons`. The names of those files (without extension) represent icon names. Different themes may have different naming conventions and additional icons.

Bear in mind that icon names can be different across different themes, and some applications might use custom icons that are not available in other themes. KDE itself complies with the Freedesktop "Icon Naming Specification," which you can find online, but this won't cover every single icon you might find on your system.
