**Prompt:**
in kde plasma on manjaro linux, using kdialog or similar, and paying attention to the documented abilities of each tool, is it possible to set a large font size in a notification?

**Response:**
No, it is not possible to set a large font size in a notification using kdialog or similar tools in KDE Plasma on Manjaro Linux according to the documented abilities of each tool. 

Kdialog notifications are strictly text-based and, as of now, they do not have any options for customizing the font size directly on the notification. This is because the notification interface is generally controlled by the desktop environment itself (in this case, KDE Plasma) and not individual applications. 

However, the overall font size in KDE Plasma can be changed via System Settings > Fonts, which may indirectly influence notification font size, too. But this will affect all text in the environment and not just notifications. 

For more precise control over notifications you would need to edit the source code directly, or use a different tool that allows more customization.
