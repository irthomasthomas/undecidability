**Prompt:**
pretty code in markdown on arch linux terminal?

**Response:**
To display code in a pretty format in Markdown on Arch Linux Terminal, you use text encapsulated in back-ticks. The following options can be used:

For inline code writing, you can wrap it within single backticks:

```
This is an example of `inline code`.
```

For a block of code, you can wrap the text within three back-ticks. You can also specify the programming language for syntax coloring:

<pre>
```python
def hello_world():
    print("Hello, world!")
```
</pre>

Make sure that you have prerequisites like python-pygments installed in Arch Linux for syntax coloring.

Try to use `Pandoc` or `grip` to preview the markdown files in the web browser. `Grip` is a command-line server application to render GitHub's like markdown.

To install the grip:

- Open the Terminal application
- Type: `sudo pacman -S python-pip` then press `Enter`.
- After Python Pip is installed, install `grip` using Pip: `pip install grip`.
- Now you can preview your markdown file with `grip -b file.md` in your browser.

Use `vi` or `Vim` for editing markdown files directly from the console. You can download Vim with `sudo pacman -Syu vim`. For `vi`, it comes pre-installed in almost every Unix-like OS.

Also, `nano` can be used for simple and quick editing directly from the console. Download nano with `sudo pacman -Syu nano`.

To increase the readability and the aesthetic of your markdown file in the console, use syntax coloring in Vim or nano. Check their respective manuals (`man vim` & `man nano`) for details.
