**Prompt:**
I have a note from an engineer. Here it is: "# Note: Not sure its a good idea having a sudo command in .zshrc file. Should make a seperate file of personal startup actions.". Is this note actionable? \- An actionable note will contain something that needs to be done, or researched (or researched and then done). \- Like a problem, or new feature required. \- Or some code or function than needs to be fixed, refactored or expanded. \- If the Note text is a typical code note, reminder, or explanation then it is not actionable.
Please classify as 'true' for actionable or 'false' for non-actionable.
