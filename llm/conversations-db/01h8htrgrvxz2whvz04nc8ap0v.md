**Prompt:**
is it possible to shell out while using elinks or send the current page to some bash command etc?

**Response:**
Yes, absolutely. Elinks has built-in support for "shell out" functionality and even scripting. However, these could potentially pose security risks, so make sure you understand what you are doing before opening your system to any possible malicious scripts you may inadvertently encounter.

With Elinks open, you can press the "!" key, which allows you to run a shell command. For instance, you can type "pwd" to print out the current directory path. Enter a command and press return to execute it. The output will appear in a new tab in Elinks.

You can also create a bash-script and bind it to a key to save or process the current page. You can use the "elinks -source" command to get the HTML of the current page.

This is all possible because Elinks is a fully-scriptable browser with ECMAScript (JavaScript) capabilities, a key feature which distinguishes it from most other text-based browsers.
