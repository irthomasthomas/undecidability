**Prompt:**
list some extra advanced shell stuff you can do with elinks to use the content of webpages in a command

**Response:**
1. **Download Webpage Content:** You can use ELinks to download the content of a webpage to a text file using a command like `elinks -dump "http://example.com" > example.txt`. This file can then be further manipulated using other shell commands.

2. **Use ELinks within Scripts:** ELinks can be used within shell scripts to parse data from webpages and use this data for automation tasks. For example, you could write a script that uses ELinks to pull down a webpage, grep for certain content, and then act based on the presence or absence of that content.

3. **Auto reading RSS feeds:** By combining redirect to file with grep or awk, you can automate reading RSS feeds or checking specific news updates. Example command: `elinks -dump "http://rss.cnn.com/rss/cnn_topstories.rss" | grep "<title>"`

4. **Emailer:** Using Elinks in connection with a command line emailer such as mutt, you could presumably automate sending certain webpage content to a recipient. 

5. **Text Web Scraping:** You could use Elinks along with grep, awk, or sed to perform text-based web scraping, extracting specific items from a web page's dumped content.

6. **Website Monitoring:** Elinks used with a cron job can monitor certain elements on a website and alert you for any changes. 

7. **HTTP Status Check:** You can use Elinks to quickly check the HTTP status of a list of URLs.

8. **Piping into other commands:** You can pipe the text extraction into other commands for real-time processing. For example: `elinks -dump "http://example.com" | wc -l` This will count the number of lines in the web page.
