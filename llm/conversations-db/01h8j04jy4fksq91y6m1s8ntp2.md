**Prompt:**
In arch linux, can rules for uri passing in elinks be configured from a file? Or must they be added from within elinks menu system?

**Response:**
In Arch Linux, rules for URI passing in ELinks can be configured from a file called "elinks.conf" in the user's home directory. This file allows you to specify rules for handling different types of URIs, including protocols and specific domains.

To add rules from within the ELinks menu system, you would need to access the ELinks settings by pressing the Esc key to open the main menu, then navigate to the "Options" section and select "URI passing rules". From there, you can manually add or modify the rules.

However, it is generally recommended to directly edit the "elinks.conf" file instead of using the menu system, as it provides more flexibility and allows you to define complex rules.

Note that the location of the "elinks.conf" file may vary depending on your specific setup and configuration, but it is typically found in the "~/.elinks/" directory.
