**Prompt:**
In arch linux, can rules for uri passing in elinks be configured from a file? Or must they be added from within elinks menu system?

**Response:**
In Arch Linux, configuration of rules for URI passing in ELinks can be done either through the ELinks menu system or by directly modifying the `elinks.conf` configuration file, which is typically located in the `.elinks` subdirectory of the user's home directory.

If the `elinks.conf` file does not exist, you may need to create one using the default configuration file as a template. You can usually find the default configuration file at `/etc/elinks/elinks.conf`.

Remember to make a backup of the original `elinks.conf` file before making changes to it. Your changes to `elinks.conf` will take effect next time you launch ELinks.

**Prompt:**
how do i add a uri passing rule to the elinks.conf and then configure a key binding"


**Response:**
You can directly edit the `elinks.conf` file to add a URI passing rule. Firstly, remember to make a backup of the original `elinks.conf` file before making changes to it. 

Below is an example of what a URI passing rule in the `elinks.conf` may look like:

```bash
# In elinks.conf
set protocol.file.uri_passing = 1
set protocol.http.uri_passing = 1
set protocol.https.uri_passing = 1
```
The rules above configure ELinks to pass file, HTTP, and HTTPS URIs to an external handler.

After adding your URI passing rules, you can define key bindings in the same `elinks.conf` file:

```bash
# In elinks.conf
bind "main" "Ctrl-t" = "goto-url"
```

In the example above, pressing `Ctrl-t` in ELinks' main view will execute the "goto-url" command, which asks for a URL to go to. 

Please replace the string "goto-url" with the appropriate command you wish to use for your own rule.

Save your changes and quit the text editor to finish defining the key binding. The changes should take effect the next time you start ELinks.

Note: The key bindings are highly customizable and can be assigned to different "contexts" within ELinks, such as the "main" context in the example above. You might need to search ELinks documentation for the correct context and commands for your particular setup.
