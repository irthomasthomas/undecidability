**Prompt:**
In arch linux, add an elinks rule for uri passing to pass the current page url to xclip, using a config file. Then add a keybinding for it

**Response:**
First, you need to create a new file in the ~/.elinks folder named hooks.pl with the following content.

```perl
#!/usr/bin/perl

use strict;
use warnings;

sub pre_format_html_hook {
    my ( $url, $title, $document ) = @_;
    system("echo $url | xclip -selection clipboard");
    return $document;
}

1;
```
This script will copy the URL of each page you visit to your clipboard. If you want a different behavior (like only copying the URL when a specific key is pressed), you'll have to modify the script accordingly.

Secondly, configure Elinks to use this script. Add the following line to ~/.elinks/elinks.conf :

```
set document.browse.hooks.pre_format_html = "/path/to/your/home/.elinks/hooks.pl"
```

Replace "/path/to/your/home/" with the actual path leading to your home directory.

About the keybinding, it is not possible to bind a key to execute external commands in Elinks. However, you can bind a key to an "elinks command" thanks to the bind command in the elinks configuration file as follow:

```
bind  "main"  "F1"  = "go"
```
But those "elinks commands" are predefined commands such as open a new tab or reload the page etc, nothing for clipboard copying.

So you would need to use stuff like `xdotool` or other native ways related to your desktop environment/window manager to achieve that. That's not the most convenient and depends a lot on what you have at your disposal.

The right tool you may want to look for is a web browser with a CLI-oriented browsing with better scripting capabilities for such use cases like Qutebrowser or Surf.


NOTE: `xclip` will need an X server connection to connect to. So this will only work if you are running Elinks in a terminal emulator in an X session. Running Elinks in a virtual console will not work.
