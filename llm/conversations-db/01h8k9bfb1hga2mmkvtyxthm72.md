**Prompt:**
in kde plasma, set a window so that it never closes


**Response:**
In KDE Plasma, you can use the "Keep Above" feature to ensure that a window never closes or gets hidden behind other windows. Here's how to do it:

1. Open the window that you want to keep on top.
2. Right-click on the window title bar or the window border.
3. From the context menu, hover over "More Actions" and click on "Keep Above" from the expanded sub-menu.

That's it! The window will now remain on top of all other windows and will not close unless you manually close it.
