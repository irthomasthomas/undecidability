**Prompt:**
what does kde plasma keep-above do?

**Response:**
The "Keep Above" option in KDE Plasma ensures that the selected window remains on top of all other windows, regardless of whether it is active or not. This means it won't be hidden by other windows you may open or use afterwards. It's useful for keeping certain applications (like a music player, chat box, etc.) visible at all times.

**Prompt:**
is it possible to set a window so that it cannot be closed?

**Response:**
In general, you cannot natively set a window so that it can't be closed in KDE Plasma as this function would interfere with user control over the operating system. However, some specific applications might provide this functionality within their own settings. 

If a user wants a program to run continuously without worry of it being accidentally closed, one can consider running it in a separate workspace or setting it to open automatically upon system startup. 

A more extreme method, not recommended unless it's completely necessary and the user is aware of the security implications, involves changing the permissions of the program's files so that the normal user can execute/read the program, but not modify or delete it. This entails a certain level of technical expertise and system administration privilege.
