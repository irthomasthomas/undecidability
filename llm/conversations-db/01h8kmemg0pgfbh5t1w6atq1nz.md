**Prompt:**
apropos keyword | awk \{print $1}\ | xargs -n1 man

**Response:**
This command-line script performs three main operations:

- `apropos keyword`: This is used to search the man page descriptions for instances of the keyword. It outputs a list of matching man pages and their descriptions.

- `awk {print $1}`: `awk` is a programming language that is particularly good at text processing and manipulation. `{print $1}` tells `awk` to print the first field â€” in this case, the name of the man page.

- `xargs -n1 man`: `xargs` is a command that reads items from standard input and executes another command (here, `man`) with these items. `-n1` specifies that `xargs` should use one item per command line.

So, taken as a whole, this command-line script is searching for a keyword in man pages and then printing out each of those man pages in full, one after the other. It's an efficient way of finding all relevant man pages for a particular topic or command.

**Prompt:**
now I want to pass content of each man page found to a tool called ttok

**Response:**
Sure, you can achieve this by implementing a pipeline. However, depending on what you wish to do with "ttok", you may have to pass the contents to it in different ways. Without a specific application for "ttok", the general format would look something like this:

```bash
apropos keyword | awk '{print $1}' | xargs -n1 -I{} sh -c 'man {} | ttok'
```

Here `-I{}` means replacing each argument `{}` of the command. The `sh -c` command runs the specified commands in a sub-shell, allowing us to pipe the output of each man page to `ttok`.

Just replace `keyword` with the keyword you want to search in the man pages. Do note that the actual usage may differ based on the way ttok is designed to take input.
