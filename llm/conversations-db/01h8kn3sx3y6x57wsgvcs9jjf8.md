**Prompt:**
loop over output of: apropos -k "^gh-". echo the name and size of each page. Additionally, if possible, find the name and length or size of the largest section in a page

**Response:**
You can accomplish this by combining several shell commands. Here's a script you can run.

```bash
apropos -k "^gh-" | awk '{print $1; system("man -P cat " $1 "| wc -c")}' | while read -r name; read -r size; do
    echo "Page Name: $name"
    echo "Page Size: $size"
    section_sizes=$(man "$name" | awk '/^ .*/{print length}' | sort -nr | head -1)
    largest_section=$(man "$name" | awk -v len="$section_sizes" '/^ .*/ && length == len' | head -1)
    echo "Largest section of: $name is: $largest_section with length: $section_sizes"
done
```

This script starts by running `apropos -k "^gh-"` to search for man pages starting with gh-. It then runs `man -P cat` for each page to get the plain text of the page and pipes it to `wc -c` to get its size.

It then reads the output line by line, with the man page name and size on alternating lines, echoed them.

Then for each man page, it again pulls the plain text with `man`, this time piping it to an awk script that prints the length of each section (defined as lines starting with a space).

The sizes of the sections are sorted and the largest is taken, and then in a similar way as before, `awk` is used to extract the first section of that size from the man page.

Please note, the script utilizes several commands and filters, thus make sure your environment supports all of them. Also, it assumes that sections in the man pages are defined as lines starting with a space which might not be true for all versions and variations of man pages across all systems and shells.

Also, measuring "size" of a man page or its section can be subjective. The script considers it as a count of characters, but it can be adapted to count words or lines if needed by replacing `wc -c` with `wc -w` or `wc -l` respectively.
