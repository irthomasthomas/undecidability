**Prompt:**
Think it through carefully! loop over output of: apropos -k "^gh-". echo the name and size of each page. Additionally, if possible, find the name and length or size of the largest section in a page

**Response:**
Here is a script that does what you asked for. It uses `apropos`, `man`, `wc`, `awk`, `sort` and `head` commands. 

```bash
#!/bin/bash

# Loop over the output of apropos -k "^gh-"
apropos -k "^gh-" | while read -r line; do
    # Extract the name of the page
    page_name=$(echo $line | awk '{print $1}')
    # Get the size of the page
    page_size=$(man $page_name | wc -c)
    echo "Page Name: $page_name"
    echo "Page Size: $page_size"

    # Get the name and length of the largest section in a page
    largest_section=$(man $page_name | awk '/^   [A-Z]/ {print $0}' | awk '{print length, $0}' | sort -n -r | head -n 1)
    largest_section_name=$(echo $largest_section | cut -d' ' -f2-)
    largest_section_size=$(echo $largest_section | cut -d' ' -f1)
    echo "Largest Section Name: $largest_section_name"
    echo "Largest Section Size: $largest_section_size"
    echo "----------------------------------------"
done
```

This script first uses `apropos` to find man pages that start with "gh-". It then loops over each of these pages, uses `man` to display the page, and `wc` to count the number of characters (size) of the page. 

It also finds the largest section in each page by looking for lines that start with three spaces and an uppercase letter (which is the format for section headers in man pages), counting the length of each of these lines, sorting them in reverse numerical order, and taking the first one. The name and size of the largest section are then extracted and displayed. 

Please note that this script might not work perfectly for all man pages, as the formatting can vary. Also, it assumes that the largest section is the one with the longest header, which might not always be what you want. 

Also, please note that the `apropos -k "^gh-"` command might not return any result if there are no man pages that start with "gh-". You can replace "^gh-" with any other keyword that matches the man pages you are interested in.
