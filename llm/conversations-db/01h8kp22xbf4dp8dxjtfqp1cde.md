**Prompt:**
explain: GROFF_NO_SGR=1

**Response:**
GROFF_NO_SGR=1 is an environment variable used with the Groff (GNU troff) text processing system. 

Groff is a program that takes input files in the "groff" language and produces formatted output, typically for printing or display. The output can include various formatting effects, such as bold text, underlining, and color.

The GROFF_NO_SGR=1 environment variable is used to disable the use of SGR (Select Graphic Rendition) escape sequences in the output of Groff. SGR sequences are a standard way to control text formatting and colors in terminal environments.

By setting GROFF_NO_SGR=1, the output of Groff will not include any SGR escape sequences. This can be useful in cases where the output is being processed further, such as when it is being piped to another program or being redirected to a file. Disabling SGR sequences can ensure that the output is clean and free from any unwanted formatting information.

Overall, GROFF_NO_SGR=1 is an environment variable that allows users to control the use of SGR escape sequences in the output produced by the Groff text processing system.
