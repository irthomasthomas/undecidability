**Prompt:**
How can I always suppress these errors? troff:<standard input>:11: warning: cannot select font 'C'

**Response:**
The error you're seeing is likely because the 'C' font doesn't exist or isn't accessible in the directory troff is trying to access. To suppress this error, you can either ensure the 'C' font is in a directory accessible by troff or you can redirect stderr outputs to /dev/null effectively silencing them.

For the latter, you can use the command:

```
command 2> /dev/null
```

Just replace "command" with your particular command. This redirects the stderr output to /dev/null, which is a special file that discards the information written to it.

For instance, if you're running `troff` directly, you'd use:

```
troff 2> /dev/null
```

This would effectively silence all warnings and error messages from troff. However, be aware that this will also silence all warnings and errors, even ones that might be critical. It's a good practice to ensure the errors aren't critical before suppressing them like this.

**Prompt:**
I am not running troff directly

**Response:**
If you're not running the `troff` command directly, the warning is probably coming from a script or program which is. It's a bit more difficult to suppress the warning in this case because you have to modify the script or program itself.

If the script is a shell script, you can add `2>/dev/null` after the command that's running `troff`. If it's a different type of script or a compiled program, the method to suppress warnings or errors will vary.

If you're not sure where the warning is coming from, you can try redirecting all `stderr` of the entire script to `/dev/null` using:

```bash
./yourscript.sh 2>/dev/null
```

Remember though, suppressing warnings and errors might also hide useful or critical information. If possible, try to resolve the source of the error first, for example, by installing the missing font.
