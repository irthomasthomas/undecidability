**Prompt:**
What is the exact zsh command to: switch to another pacman branch?


**Response:**
To switch to another pacman branch in zsh, you can use the following command:

```zsh
sudo pacman-mirrors --api --set-branch <branch_name>
```

Replace `<branch_name>` with the name of the branch you want to switch to. For example, if you want to switch to the `testing` branch, the command would be:

```zsh
sudo pacman-mirrors --api --set-branch testing
```

After running this command, you may need to update your package list by running `sudo pacman -Sy` to reflect the changes made by switching to the new branch.
