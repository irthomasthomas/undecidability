**Prompt:**
In manjaro/arch, suggest tips for getting best quality from dvd played with mpv player

**Response:**
1. Use Hardware Acceleration: Enabling hardware acceleration in mpv can improve DVD playback experience. Make sure to install relevant VAAPI or VDPAU packages for your video card.

2. Update MPV Player: It's always wise to have the latest version of the player installed.

3. Install Necessary Codecs: Sometimes, quality might be degraded because the necessary codecs aren't installed. Ensure you have all required codecs.

4. Increase Cache: Increasing the cache size will allow mpv to buffer more of the DVD, resulting in smoother playback. You can adjust this in the config file.

5. Use High-quality Interpolation: Interpolation can assist to smooth pixels that might otherwise be noticeable. This can be enabled in the config file.

6. Increase Audio Quality: By default, mpv uses a low quality audio resampler. You can switch to a high quality one in the settings.

7. Enable Debanding: Debanding can remove 'banding' artifacts from the video, which are often present in highly compressed content.

8. Config File Adjustments: To get the best quality, you may need to adjust mpv configuration files. These are usually located in ~/.config/mpv/mpv.conf.

Example of configuration adjustments:

    #improve video quality
    profile=opengl-hq
    #improve audio quality
    audio-samplerate=96000
    #increase cache sizes
    cache=8192
    cache-initial=10
    cache-seek-min=10
    #enable debanding
    deband=true

Please be mindful that increasing quality settings can put more load on your system. Make sure your system is capable to handle it.
