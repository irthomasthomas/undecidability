**Prompt:**
in manjaro/arch, suggest best mpv flags to use with nvidia to play a dvd with best quality

**Response:**
For the best video and audio quality in Manjaro/Arch using mpv media player, consider the following flags:

```
mpv --vo=gpu --gpu-api=opengl --gpu-context=drm --hwdec=nvdec-copy --ao=alsa/pulse --vd-lavc-threads=8 DVDpath
```

Explanation:

1. `--vo=gpu` or `--vo=opengl` - Forces the use of opengl for video output, which is often more efficient and capable compared to CPU-based video output formats. 

2. `--gpu-api=opengl` - Forces the use of the OpenGL API for video decoding. 

3. `--gpu-context=drm` - Direct Rendering Manager, it is useful to bypass the Windowing system to get potentially better performance. 

4. `--hwdec=nvdec-copy` - Enables Nvidiaâ€™s hardware decoding for video files. It is generally faster and more efficient than software decoding.  

5. `--ao=alsa/pulse` - This specifies the audio output method. You can use either ALSA or PulseAudio depending on your setup. 

6. `--vd-lavc-threads=8` - This option tells mpv to use multiple threads for video decoding with the libavcodec library. Adjust the number to match the number of threads your CPU supports (if unsure, you can often safely use the number of logical cores your CPU has).

Replace "DVDpath" with the actual path to your DVD file or DVD device.

Please note that 'mpv' flags can vary depending upon the specific hardware and software configuration. You might need to tweak the above suggestions a little bit to get the best out of your hardware. 

Additionally, you can place these options inside a configuration file for mpv (usually located at `~/.config/mpv/mpv.conf`) so you don't have to input them every time you open a file.
