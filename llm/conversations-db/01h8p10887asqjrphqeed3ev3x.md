**Prompt:**
explain: named pipe in linux

**Response:**
A named pipe in Linux is a special type of file that allows communication between different processes. It is also known as a FIFO (First-In-First-Out) file. Similar to a regular pipe, a named pipe provides a way for one process to send data to another process, but the difference is that a named pipe has a unique name in the file system, which makes it accessible to other processes.

A named pipe is created using the `mkfifo` command or the `mkfifo()` system call. It creates an entry in the file system that acts as a buffer, allowing data to be written by one process and read by another process, or vice versa. The processes that communicate through the named pipe may run concurrently or at different times.

The named pipe provides bidirectional communication, meaning both reading and writing operations can be performed on the pipe. Multiple processes can write to the named pipe simultaneously, but the data will be read in the order in which it was written (FIFO). If no process is currently reading from the pipe, the writing process will block until a reader appears.

Named pipes are widely used in Linux for inter-process communication (IPC) between processes that may or may not have a pre-established relationship. They provide a simple and efficient way for processes to exchange data without requiring complex socket programming. However, named pipes have certain limitations, such as lack of security and the inability to transmit large amounts of data efficiently.

Overall, named pipes in Linux offer a convenient means of communication between different processes by providing them with a shared file-like interface. They are an essential component of IPC in the Linux operating system.
