**Prompt:**
Error: troff:<standard input>:2772: warning: cannot select font 'CW' /n How can fix this to use the CR font instead, or use some alias or redirect? Im in manjaro/arch linux

**Response:**
The error message you're seeing is because the troff typesetting system (used by man and other tools) is trying to use a font that isn't installed on your system.

You can try the following steps to fix the issue:

1. Install the missing font: The error message suggests that the 'CW' font is missing. You can try installing it using your package manager. For example, on Arch Linux, you can use the `pacman` command to install packages.

```bash
sudo pacman -S font-name
```
Replace `font-name` with the name of the package that provides the 'CW' font. You may need to search for this online or in the Arch Linux package database.

2. Create a font alias: If you can't find the 'CW' font, or you'd prefer to use the 'CR' font instead, you can create a font alias. This will tell troff to use the 'CR' font whenever it tries to use the 'CW' font.

You can do this by creating a file named `troffrc` in your home directory with the following contents:

```bash
.trf CW CR
```
This line tells troff to replace 'CW' with 'CR'. You can then tell troff to use this file by setting the `GROFF_TMAC_PATH` environment variable:

```bash
export GROFF_TMAC_PATH=~/troffrc
```
You can add this line to your shell's startup file (like `~/.bashrc` or `~/.zshrc`) to make this change permanent.

3. Use a different tool: If you're only encountering this problem when trying to view man pages, you could consider using a different tool to view them. For example, `most` is a pager that can view man pages and doesn't require any special fonts. You can install it with:

```bash
sudo pacman -S most
```
Then you can view man pages with:

```bash
man -P most command
```
Replace `command` with the name of the command you want to view the man page for.
