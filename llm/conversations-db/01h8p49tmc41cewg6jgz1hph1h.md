**Prompt:**
Think it through carefully. /nError: troff:<standard input>:2772: warning: cannot select font 'CW' /n How can fix this to use the CR font instead, or use some alias or redirect? Im in manjaro/arch linux

**Response:**
The error message you're seeing is because the troff utility is trying to use a font that doesn't exist or isn't installed on your system.

You can try to fix this issue by following these steps:

1. Identify the document that is causing the problem. The error message should give you a line number (2772 in this case), which can help you find the problematic part of the document.

2. Once you've found the problematic part of the document, look for a ".ft CW" directive. This directive is what's telling troff to use the CW font. 

3. Change the ".ft CW" directive to ".ft CR" to use the CR font instead. If the CR font isn't installed on your system, you'll need to install it.

4. If you want to use an alias or redirect, you can do so by adding a line like this to the beginning of your document:
   .char CW \C'CR'
   This line tells troff to replace any instances of the CW font with the CR font.

5. Save your changes and try running troff again. If everything was done correctly, you shouldn't see the error message anymore.

If you're still seeing the error message after following these steps, there might be a problem with your troff installation or with the document you're trying to process. In that case, you might need to seek help from a more experienced user or from a support forum.
