**Prompt:**
what would thin do in roff? .char CW \C'CR'

**Response:**
The command `.char CW \C'CR'` in Roff (a typesetting system) defines a new character named CW that will be replaced by the carriage return symbol when encountered in the text. 

Roff uses the `.char` request to define or redefine characters. In this case, `CW` is the name of the character and `\C'CR'` is the glyph that will replace it. `\C'CR'` is a special escape sequence that represents the carriage return character. 

So, every time `CW` is used in the text, it will be replaced by a carriage return.
