**Prompt:**
where should I add an export so that it is always set?

**Response:**
If you want to set an environment variable so that it is always available, you can add the export statement in one of the following files based on your requirements:

1. ~/.bashrc or ~/.bash_profile: These files are sourced when you start an interactive non-login shell. If you want the variable to be set for a particular user, you can add the export statement to these files.

   - ~/.bashrc: This file is specific to the Bash shell and is executed for every new non-login interactive shell.
   - ~/.bash_profile: This file is executed for login shells, typically at the login time.

   To add the export statement to one of these files, open a terminal and execute:

   ```bash
   echo "export VARIABLE_NAME=variable_value" >> ~/.bashrc  # or ~/.bash_profile
   source ~/.bashrc  # or ~/.bash_profile
   ```

   The `source` command is used to apply the changes immediately in your current shell session without the need to logout and login again.

2. /etc/environment: This file is read by all users and can be useful when you want to set an environment variable system-wide. Editing this file requires administrative privileges.

   To add the export statement to this file, open a terminal and execute:

   ```bash
   sudo echo "VARIABLE_NAME=variable_value" >> /etc/environment
   ```

   After modifying this file, you may need to restart your system or re-login for the changes to take effect.

Note: Remember to replace `VARIABLE_NAME` with your desired variable name and `variable_value` with the value you want to assign to it.
