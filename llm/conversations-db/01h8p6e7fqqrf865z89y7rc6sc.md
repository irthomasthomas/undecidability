**Prompt:**
does .bashrc settings have an affect even if I use zsh?

**Response:**
No, the settings in `.bashrc` file do not have any effect when using `zsh` as your shell. `.bashrc` is specific to the Bash shell and contains configuration settings that are executed only by the Bash shell. 

If you switch to `zsh` as your default shell, you can use a similar file named `.zshrc` to configure settings for the `zsh` shell. You can copy the necessary settings from `.bashrc` to `.zshrc` or manually configure them in `.zshrc` according to the `zsh` syntax.
