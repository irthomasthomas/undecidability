**Prompt:**
where should I add an export so that it is always set?


**Response:**
To set an export so that it is always applied, you can add it to your shell's environment configuration file, typically either ~/.bashrc or ~/.bash_profile. 

Open your preferred text editor and add the following line at the end of either ~/.bashrc or ~/.bash_profile:

export VARIABLE_NAME=value

Replace `VARIABLE_NAME` with the name of the variable you want to set, and `value` with the desired value. Save the file and close the editor. 

Note that changes made to these files will only take effect in new terminal sessions or when you start a new shell. To apply the changes to your current session without logging out and logging back in, use the `source` command:

source ~/.bashrc
or
source ~/.bash_profile

Remember to restart your shell or open a new terminal window for the changes to take effect.
