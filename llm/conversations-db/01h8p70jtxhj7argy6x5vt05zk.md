**Prompt:**
I need to downgrade groff from 1.23.0-2 thats installed to a lower version 1.22.4-10 or another. Give me detailed instructions for doing this



**Response:**
Downgrading packages can be risky, as it may lead to compatibility issues or break dependencies. It is recommended to exercise caution when attempting to downgrade packages. That being said, I can provide you with the instructions to attempt the downgrade, but please proceed at your own risk.

To downgrade groff to version 1.22.4-10, you can try the following steps:

1. Open the terminal.

2. Update your package list by running the following command:
   ```
   sudo pacman -Sy
   ```

3. Search for the available versions of groff:
   ```
   sudo pacman -Ss groff
   ```

   This command will show you a list of available versions and their corresponding repositories.

4. Determine the repository that contains the desired version of groff. If the desired version is available in any enabled repository, proceed to the next steps. Otherwise, you may need to add a specific repository or find alternative methods to obtain the desired version.

5. Disable the official repository for groff to prevent automatic updates:
   ```
   sudo echo "IgnorePkg = groff" >> /etc/pacman.conf
   ```

6. Install the desired version of groff from the repository you previously identified, using the appropriate command. For example, if the desired version is available in the "community" repository, run:
   ```
   sudo pacman -S community/groff=1.22.4-10
   ```

   Please replace "community" with the actual repository name and version number with the desired version you found in step 4.

7. After the installation is complete, you can lock groff to prevent future updates:
   ```
   sudo echo "IgnorePkg = groff" >> /etc/pacman.d/mirrorlist
   ```

Please note that downgrading packages may have unintended consequences, such as breaking dependencies or causing issues with other software. Be prepared to revert or troubleshoot any issues that may arise after the downgrade.
