**Prompt:**
I need to downgrade groff from 1.23.0-2 thats installed to a lower version 1.22.4-10 or another. Give me detailed instructions for doing this


**Response:**
Downgrading packages in Manjaro involves accessing the package archives. Here are the steps:

1. Open Terminal.
2. Update the package database with `sudo pacman -Sy`.
3. Install the downgrade tool with `sudo pacman -S downgrade`.
4. Downgrade groff with `downgrade groff`.

A list of available versions will appear. Select the version you want (1.22.4-10) by typing its number and pressing Enter. Confirm the downgrade when prompted.

Remember, downgrading can cause dependency issues. If you encounter problems, consider seeking a solution that doesn't involve downgrading.
