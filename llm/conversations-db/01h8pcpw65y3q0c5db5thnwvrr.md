 how to add a keyboard shortcut for "clip" uri passing based on the included man page

**Response:**
To set a keyboard shortcut for "clip" URI passing based on the included man page, you need to create a custom shortcut. Here's an example of how you can do it on an Ubuntu system:

1. Open "Settings" and click on "Keyboard Shortcuts" at the bottom of the sidebar.

2. Scroll all the way down to the bottom and click the "+" sign to add a new shortcut.

3. In the "Name" field, type a name for the shortcut like "Clip URI".

4. In the "Command" field, type the command related to the "clip" URI. You would find this in the man page that was included. It may look something like this (this is a placeholder as I don't have the exact command): `/usr/bin/clip-uri`

5. Click the "Set Shortcut" button and press the keys you want to use for this shortcut.

6. Click "Add" to add the new shortcut.

Remember, this is just a generalized guide, your actual implementation could vary depending on your exact command for "clip" URI passing and your operating system.
