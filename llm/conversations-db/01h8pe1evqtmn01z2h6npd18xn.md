**Prompt:**
Think it through carefully! loop over output of: apropos -k "^gh-". echo the name and size of each page.

**Response:**
Here is a bash script that does what you requested. It uses the `apropos` command to search for man pages that start with "gh-", then uses `man -k` to get the size of each page, and finally prints the name and size of each page.

```bash
#!/bin/bash

# Use apropos to get a list of man pages that start with "gh-"
pages=$(apropos -k "^gh-" | awk '{print $1}')

# Loop over the pages
for page in $pages
do
    # Use man -k to get the size of the page
    size=$(man -k $page | wc -c)

    # Print the name and size of the page
    echo "Page: $page, Size: $size"
done
```

Please note that the size returned by `wc -c` is in bytes and it counts the number of characters in the output of `man -k $page`, which includes the name of the page, the section number, and the description. It does not represent the actual size of the man page file on disk. 

Also, this script assumes that the output of `apropos -k "^gh-"` is a list of man page names separated by spaces. If the output is formatted differently, the script may not work as expected.
