**Prompt:**
Think it through carefully! I want to create a vector db of gh man pages using openai embeddings. This first script just finds the man pages and checks their size. Critique the code architecture and tool choice. And look for bugs.

**Response:**
To provide a thorough critique of the code architecture and tool choice, as well as identifying any potential bugs, I'll need to review the actual code you have written. Please provide the code for the script you mentioned, and I'll be happy to assist you further.
