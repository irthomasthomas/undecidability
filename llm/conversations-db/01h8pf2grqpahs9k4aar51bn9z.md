**Prompt:**
what sort of pattern is typically used for reading and or parsing markdown code blocks. I want to use a clipboard action in kde to look for the markdown code block and identify the code type

**Response:**
When parsing Markdown code blocks, you can typically use regular expressions or specific markdown parsers to identify the code type. Markdown code blocks are typically denoted by three backticks (```) or indentation with four spaces or a tab. 

To identify the code type within a Markdown code block, you can usually check for a language identifier specified after the opening backticks, such as "```python" or "```javascript". You can extract this identifier using regular expressions or string manipulations.

Here's an example of a regular expression pattern that can be used to extract the code type from a Markdown code block:

```python
import re

# Markdown code block pattern
pattern = r"```[ \t]*(.+)?[^\n]"

# Example Markdown content
markdown_content = """
This is a sample Markdown document.

```python
print("Hello, World!")
```

```javascript
console.log("Hello, World!");
```

"""

# Extracting code type from code blocks
matches = re.findall(pattern, markdown_content)

for match in matches:
    code_type = match.strip()
    print(code_type)
```

This example would output:
```
python
javascript
```

Once you have extracted the code type, you can use it for further processing and actions according to your requirement.
