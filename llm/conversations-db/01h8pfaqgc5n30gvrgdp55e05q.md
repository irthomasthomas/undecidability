**Prompt:**
Think it through carefully. send a message to all interactive terminals


**Response:**
To send a message to all interactive terminals in KDE Plasma on Manjaro, you can use the `wall` command. However, please note that this command may not work if the users have specifically disabled it or if they are running non-interactive shells. Additionally, you need to have the appropriate permissions to use this command. Here is an example of how to use it:

```shell
echo "Your message here" | sudo wall
```

Replace "Your message here" with the actual message you want to send. The `sudo` command is used to execute `wall` with elevated privileges, as it requires root access to send messages to other users' terminals.

Please keep in mind that sending unsolicited messages to other users' terminals can be disruptive and is generally not recommended without a valid reason.
