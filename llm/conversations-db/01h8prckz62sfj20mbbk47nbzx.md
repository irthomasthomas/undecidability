**Prompt:**
What is the exact zsh command to: gh issue comment 7 --body "Template
$(llm templates show makefilename)
```'$(paste)'
```"
 what is wrong with this command??


**Response:**
The command is trying to use command substitution with `$(llm templates show makefilename)` and `'$(paste)'`, but the latter is enclosed in single quotes which prevents command substitution in shell. 

The corrected command should be:

```
gh issue comment 7 --body "Template
$(llm templates show makefilename)
\```$(paste)\```"
```

This will allow the `$(paste)` command to be executed and its output to be included in the string. The backticks are escaped to prevent them from being interpreted as command substitution.
