# iDoDid# iDoDid README

## Description
The iDoDid project is a Bash script that helps users keep track of their tasks and breaks during work sessions. It utilizes dialog boxes and screen recording to provide a seamless workflow for task management.

## Features
- Allows users to create and save tasks for different activities
- Provides countdown timer for breaks
- Records screen during work sessions
- Saves recorded videos to specified activity folders
- Supports skipping the current task and immediately starting the break

## Usage
1. Make sure that the necessary dependencies are installed:
   - kdialog: for displaying dialog boxes
   - xdotool: for simulating keyboard inputs
   - qdbus: for interacting with KDE APIs
   - llm: custom script for generating hyphenated filenames

2. Clone the iDoDid repository to your desired location:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/iDoDid.git
   ```

3. Navigate to the cloned repository:
   ```bash
   cd iDoDid
   ```

4. Open the `ido.sh` file with a text editor:
   ```bash
   nano ido.sh
   ```

5. Edit the script to customize the following variables to your preferences:
   - `ACTIVITY_HOME`: default location for activity folders
   - `SKIP_TIME`: file used to skip the current task and start the break immediately
   - `VIDEO_LOCATION`: folder to save recorded videos (optional, can be set to the same location as `ACTIVITY_HOME`)
   - `screen_recorder.sh`: path to the screen recorder script (if different from the default location)

6. Save the changes and exit the text editor.

7. Run the `ido.sh` script to start using the iDoDid tool:
   ```bash
   ./ido.sh
   ```

8. The script will display a dialog box prompting for the current activity. Select an existing activity or choose "New Activity" to create a new one.

9. Enter the tasks for the selected activity in the dialog boxes. Each task will be saved to the corresponding activity folder.

10. When the break time approaches, a passive popup notification will appear, reminding you to make a note of your progress.

11. Choose to continue working or delay the break. If you choose to delay, the script will display a countdown timer before automatically continuing.

12. Once the break time arrives, a break notification will appear. The script will then simulate pressing "Ctrl+Shift+F5" to start the screensaver and initiate the break.

13. After the break ends, the screensaver will automatically close, and the script will switch back to the previous activity.

14. Repeat the process to continue managing tasks and breaks.

## Tips
- It is recommended to create a desktop shortcut or add the script to your system's autostart to easily access the iDoDid tool.
- Customize the script according to your preferences and workflow.
- Feel free to modify and enhance the script to fit your specific needs.
- Make sure to have enough disk space in the video location folder, as the recorded videos can consume a significant amount of storage.
- Test the script thoroughly before using it in a production environment.
- Visit the [iDoDid GitHub repository](https://github.com/your-username/iDoDid) for any updates, issues, or feature requests.
