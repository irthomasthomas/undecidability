**Prompt:**
update the function definition for a given bash function. eg: which myfunction

**Response:**
Updating a function definition in bash typically involves redefining the function in your script or bash shell. Let's say your current function `myfunction()` looks like this:

```bash
myfunction() {
  echo "This is my old function"
}
```

This function will print "This is my old function" when called:

```bash
$ myfunction
This is my old function
```

You can update its definition by writing a new definition for `myfunction()`, perhaps in the same script or in your bash shell:

```bash
myfunction() {
  echo "This is my updated function"
}
```

Now, when you call `myfunction` it will do different things:

```bash
$ myfunction
This is my updated function
```

Remember you have to source your script or restart your shell for changes to take effect.

If you're looking for the definition of a particular function using the `which` command, it won't work because `which` is used for locating executables. Instead, you can use the `type` command in bash:

```bash
$ type myfunction
```

This will tell you if `myfunction` exists and will show you its definition.

**Prompt:**
no, I want, e.g. one script to update/replace the function definition in another

**Response:**
Bash does not have a straight way of modifying a function definition in another script because each shell script executes in its own process and has its own memory, and it does not share its function definitions with other scripts.

However, if you want to source a script which contains a function definition which you want to replace in the current script, you can do it by redefining the function after sourcing the script. Here is an example:

File `myscript.sh`:

```bash
#!/bin/bash
myfunction() {
  echo "This is my old function"
}
```

And in another script you can do this:

```bash
#!/bin/bash
source myscript.sh  # This sources the first script, including its function definition.
myfunction  # This calls the function as defined so far.

myfunction() {  # Here we redefine the function.
  echo "This is my updated function"
}
myfunction  # This calls the updated function.
```

Running the second script will output:

```bash
This is my old function
This is my updated function
```

This proves that the function was first defined according to the first script, then redefined in the second script.
