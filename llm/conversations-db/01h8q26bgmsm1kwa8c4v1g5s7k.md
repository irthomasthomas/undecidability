**Prompt:**
which: maximum nested function level reached; increase FUNCNEST?
 which() { declare -f | which --read-functions $@ }

**Response:**
`FUNCNEST` is a shell variable in bash which controls the maximum function nesting level. It is used to prevent infinite recursion in functions. If an undefined FPAT variable causes the maximum nested function level to be reached you will get a 'maximum nested function level reached' error.

The `which: maximum nested function level reached; increase FUNCNEST?` error means that you have reached the maximum nested function level in your `which()` function. 

This is happening because your function is calling itself recursively without an exit condition, resulting in an infinite loop.

The `which()` function you defined is calling `which --read-functions $@` inside itself. This might be what's causing the recursion.

You should increase the `FUNCNEST` value to allow deeper function nesting (but this is not suggested because the underlying issue of infinite recursion remains) or, better, revise the logic in your function to remove the infinite recursion.

Changing the `FUNCNEST` value can be done through the command: `shopt -s funcnest=<value>` in command line where <value> could be any integer. The default `FUNCNEST` value is 1000 in bash 4.3+. 

But note that changing `FUNCNEST` beyond its default 1000 does open up your script to potential stack overflow crashes.
