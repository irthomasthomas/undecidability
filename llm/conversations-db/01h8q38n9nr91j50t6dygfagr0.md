**Prompt:**
what is whence is zsh?

**Response:**
Zsh is a highly customizable and feature-rich shell program for Unix-like operating systems. The name "zsh" stands for Z-Shell, and it is an extended version of the Bourne shell (sh) with added features and improvements.

The word "whence" is a built-in command in zsh that is used to determine the origin or location of a command or a shell function. It provides information about the file path from where a particular command or function is being executed. By using the "whence" command, you can easily find the location of executables, aliases, shell built-in commands, and the source files of shell functions in zsh.

```bash
help whence
```

This will display the relevant information, including the usage and options, directly in the zsh shell.

```bash
help
```

This will show all the built-in commands and functions along with a brief description for each.

Additionally, you can also explore the official zsh documentation available online, which provides comprehensive details about the shell and its features.
