**Prompt:**
what is whence, in zsh?

**Response:**
In Zsh, "whence" is a shell built-in command used to find out the path of a command. It is similar to the "type" command in Bash. It can show whether a command is a shell built-in, an alias, a file in the current directory, or a file in the directories listed in the PATH variable. It can also show the actual path of the command file.

**Prompt:**
how can I see what flags are valid for whence

**Response:**
You can use the 'man' command to see the manual and get detailed information about 'whence' including its valid flags. Just type 'man whence' in your terminal and press enter. 

However, in most cases, the valid option flags for 'whence' in zsh are as follows:

- `-v` :  causes the shell to print a description of each argument
- `-a` : causes the shell to print all of the places that contain an executable named
- `-c` : prints the results in a csh-like format 
- `-f` : hides the function definitions
- `-p` : does the search using a default path, ignoring the contents of the PATH variable

Remember that these flags can be combined together as needed.
