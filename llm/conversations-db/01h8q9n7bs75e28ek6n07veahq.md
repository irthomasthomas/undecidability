**Prompt:**
check error messages to diagnose problem on manjaro

**Response:**
To identify a problem on Manjaro, it can be helpful to look at error messages in the system log files. A log file is a file that maintains a registry of events, processes, and messages that take place between an operating system and hardware.

There are many ways to check error messages in Manjaro. Here are a few methods:

1. Journalctl: You can use `journalctl` command, it's used to query the contents of the systemd journal.

Command: `journalctl -p err -b`

This command will show all error priority (-p err) messages from this boot (-b).

2. System Log Viewer: Usually, Linux distributions come with a tool to view log files in a more user-friendly way. For Manjaro, there's a log viewer included if you are using the GNOME desktop environment. Look in your system tools for "Logs", or run this command in shell: `gnome-logs`.

3. Via Terminal and Text Editors: You can use the terminal and a text editor to view the logs. For example, the `dmesg` command is used to display the kernel-related messages. If you only want to view the error messages, execute following command: `dmesg -l err`.

Also, the most of system logs in Linux are located in `/var/log` directory.

4. Using Syslog: If `syslog` is enabled, check the `/var/log/syslog` file. You can open this in less with following command: `less /var/log/syslog` Then, you can easily navigate through the log file to check the error messages.
  
5. Use GUI-based log viewer: You can use KDE Log Viewer or GNOME System Log Viewer, depending on your desktop environment. These tools will give an easy interface to inspect various log files.  
   
Remember, understanding system logs is important for diagnosing problems with your system. Some messages may not be errors at all, but rather warnings and informational messages that don't necessarily indicate a problem. It's important to understand the context of an error before jumping to conclusions.
