 problems in manjaro after recent update

**Response:**
There are several different problems showing up in your logs:

1. There are a series of error messages related to failing in calling EVIOCSKEYCODE with specific scan code and key code. It seems like it might be a driver or software issue, potentially related to your keyboard configuration or related device input.

2. The system is failing to find the Bluetooth firmware. This error message suggests that the system is looking for 'brcm/BCM20702A1-0a5c-21e8.hcd' and 'brcm/BCM-0a5c-21e8.hcd' but cannot find these files. 

3. There appears to be some issue with the Bluetooth: 'corrupted ACL packet' and 'ACL packet for unknown connection handle 12'.

4. An error from 'systemd' relates to: 'Failed to start Update XDG user dir configuration'. The XDG user directory configuration script failed to start for some reason.

5. There are warnings about the konsole where elements are being set with QAction::setShortcut instead of KActionCollection::setDefaultShortcut(s).

Possible solutions could include checking and updating your system, checking and reinstalling drivers, looking for the missing Bluetooth files and putting them in the correct location, checking the status of systemd services related to XDG user dir configuration, and checking Konsole settings.

As the solutions could be quite broad and system-specific, it could help to search for each error message separately in Manjaro or Linux forums to find more specific tips and solutions.
