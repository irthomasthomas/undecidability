The error message suggests that there is an issue with a numeric value at line 1, column 10 of the content you provided. However, without the actual content, it is difficult to determine the specific problem. 

To resolve this issue, you can check that the numeric value at that location is written correctly. There could be a typo, an extra or missing character, or an invalid format causing the error.
