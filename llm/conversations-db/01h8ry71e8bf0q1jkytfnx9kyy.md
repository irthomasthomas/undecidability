 after running jq on the handbrake file below, it says parse error: invalid numeric literal at line 1, columnt 10.

**Response:**
The error message indicates that there is an issue with the numeric value at line 1, column 10 in the Handbrake file. To identify the specific problem, you need to examine the content of the file.

However, based on the provided information, it seems that there is a typo in the error message itself. The error message states "columnt" instead of "column". This could be a typo while copying the error message here.

To troubleshoot the issue, you can check the value at line 1, column 10 in the Handbrake file and ensure that it is a valid numeric value. It might be helpful to provide the full content of the file for further analysis if the issue persists.
