**Prompt:**
What is the exact zsh command to: search inside all .log files for "deinterlace"?


**Response:**
To search inside all .log files for "deinterlace" using zsh, you can use the following command:

find .log -type f -exec grep -H "deinterlace" {} +

Here's how it works:

* `find .log`: This command searches for files in the current directory and its subdirectories.
* `-type f`: This option specifies that we only want to search for files, not directories.
* `-exec grep -H "deinterlace" {} +`: This option executes the `grep` command on each file found, with the `-H` option to show the file name and line number for each match. The `{}` placeholder is used to represent the file name in the command. The `+` at the end of the option tells `find` to execute the command once for each file.

So, this command will search for the string "deinterlace" in all files with the .log extension in the current directory and its subdirectories, and display the file name and line number for each match.
