**Prompt:**
What is the exact zsh command to: concatenate the h265 mp4 files called DVD-{1..12}.mp4?


**Response:**
The exact zsh command to concatenate the h265 mp4 files called DVD-{1..12}.mp4 is:

```zsh
ffmpeg -i "concat:$(printf 'DVD-%d.mp4|' {1..12})" -c copy output.mp4
```

This command uses `ffmpeg` to concatenate the files. It uses the `printf` command to generate the list of file names, and then uses the `concat` protocol to concatenate them. The resulting concatenated file is saved as `output.mp4`.

**Prompt:**
that only used the first file

**Response:**
Apologies for the incorrect response. To concatenate the h265 mp4 files called DVD-{1..12}.mp4 using `ffmpeg` in zsh, you can use the following command:

```zsh
ffmpeg -f concat -i <(for f in DVD-{1..12}.mp4; do echo "file '$PWD/$f'"; done) -c copy output.mp4
```

This command uses process substitution `<( )` in order to construct the input file list for `ffmpeg`. It loops through the filenames DVD-1.mp4 to DVD-12.mp4, and creates a list of file paths to be concatenated by `ffmpeg`. The resulting concatenated file is saved as `output.mp4`.

**Prompt:**
[concat @ 0x5623ebc34e00] Unsafe file name '/home/tommy/Videos/DVD-1.mp4'
/proc/self/fd/13: Operation not permitted


**Response:**
Apologies for the error. The error you encountered occurs when `ffmpeg` encounters a file name with certain characters or a path with spaces. To address this issue, you can modify the command as follows:

```zsh
ffmpeg -f concat -safe 0 -i <(for f in DVD-{1..12}.mp4; do echo "file '$PWD/$f'"; done) -c copy output.mp4
```

The addition of the `-safe 0` flag tells `ffmpeg` to consider all paths as safe. This should resolve the "Unsafe file name" error you encountered.
