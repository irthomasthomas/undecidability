**Prompt:**
Problem: I took some video of lightning last night. The videos have long sections of darknes and a few frames with the lightning. Making it difficult for me to find the sections with the lightning easily. Think of some possible hacks to make that easier


**Response:**
One possible hack to make it easier to find the sections with lightning in your videos is to use a video editor with a frame-by-frame preview feature. This will allow you to scrub through the video frame by frame and quickly identify the frames with lightning. You can then mark these frames or extract them as separate clips for easy access later on.

Another option is to use a video analysis tool that can detect changes in brightness or motion. These tools can automatically identify the frames with lightning based on the sudden increase in brightness or movement. Once the lightning frames are detected, you can either mark them or extract them as separate clips for easier viewing.

Please keep in mind that these suggestions are general and may vary depending on the specific software or tools you have available.

**Prompt:**
Expand on the video analysis idea. What are my options?

**Response:**
One option for video analysis is to use an open-source tool called OpenCV. OpenCV is a powerful computer vision library that provides various functions for video analysis and processing. You can use OpenCV to detect changes in brightness or motion in your videos, which can help you identify the frames with lightning.

To get started, you can install OpenCV on your Manjaro system by running the following command:

```
sudo pacman -S opencv
```

Once installed, you can use Python and OpenCV to write a script that analyzes your videos. Here's a basic outline of the steps you can follow:

1. Import the necessary libraries:
```python
import cv2
import numpy as np
```

2. Load the video file:
```python
cap = cv2.VideoCapture('path/to/your/video.mp4')
```

3. Define the threshold values for changes in brightness or motion:
```python
brightness_threshold = 30  # Adjust this value as needed
motion_threshold = 10000  # Adjust this value as needed
```

4. Iterate through the frames of the video:
```python
while cap.isOpened():
    ret, frame = cap.read()
    if not ret:
        break
    
    # Convert the frame to grayscale for brightness analysis
    gray = cv2.cvtColor(frame, cv2.COLOR_BGR2GRAY)

    # Calculate the brightness difference between frames
    difference = cv2.absdiff(gray, previous_frame)

    # Calculate the total brightness difference
    brightness_diff = np.sum(difference)

    # Calculate the motion in the frame
    motion = cv2.Laplacian(gray, cv2.CV_64F).var()

    # Check if the brightness difference or motion exceeds the thresholds
    if brightness_diff > brightness_threshold or motion > motion_threshold:
        # This frame likely contains lightning

    # Store the current frame as the previous frame for the next iteration
    previous_frame = gray.copy()
```

In the above code, you can adjust the `brightness_threshold` and `motion_threshold` values according to your specific needs. Frames with brightness differences or motion above these thresholds can be considered to contain lightning.

Please note that this is a basic example and may require further adjustments or enhancements based on the characteristics of your videos. Additionally, video analysis can be computationally intensive, so it may take some time to process large videos.

Remember to consult the OpenCV documentation and explore its various functions to customize your video analysis further.
