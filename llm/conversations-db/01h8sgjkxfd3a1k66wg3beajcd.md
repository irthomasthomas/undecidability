**Response:**
The given command is a cURL command that makes an API request to the Kagi search API. It uses the Authorization header with a token read from a file located at $HOME/Development/.kagi.

To write a Python Click CLI app to use the search API and save non-empty search results in a unique file, you can follow these steps:

1. Install the required dependencies:
   ```
   pip install click requests
   ```

2. Create a new Python file, e.g., `search_app.py`, and import the necessary modules:
   ```python
   import click
   import requests
   import json
   import os
   ```

3. Define a command group using the `@click.group()` decorator:
   ```python
   @click.group()
   def cli():
       pass
   ```

4. Define a command to perform the search and save the results:
   ```python
   @cli.command()
   @click.option('--query', '-q', help='Search query')
   @click.option('--log-off', is_flag=True, help='Flag to disable saving search results')
   def search(query, log_off):
       headers = {
           'Authorization': f'Bot {open(os.path.expanduser("~/Development/.kagi")).read()}'
       }
       url = f'https://kagi.com/api/v0/enrich/web?q={query}'
       response = requests.get(url, headers=headers)
       data = response.json()

       if data['data']:
           filename = f'{query.replace(" ", "_")}.json'
           with open(filename, 'w') as file:
               json.dump(data, file)
               click.echo(f'Search results saved to {filename}')
       elif not log_off:
           click.echo('No search results found')
   ```

5. Add the command group to the main function and invoke it:
   ```python
   if __name__ == '__main__':
       cli()
   ```

You can then run the CLI app by executing the Python script:
```
python search_app.py search --query "search terms"
```

This will perform the search using the given query and save the results in a JSON file with a unique name. If the `--log-off` flag is passed, the search results will not be saved.
