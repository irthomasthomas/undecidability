**Prompt:**
What is the exact zsh command to: in terminal png viewer, or quickest/smallest tool to open them??


**Response:**
The exact zsh command to open a PNG file using the default image viewer in your system would be:

```zsh
xdg-open image.png
```

This command uses the `xdg-open` utility, which is a cross-desktop tool for opening files using the default application associated with their file type.

If you prefer a specific image viewer, you can replace `xdg-open` with the command for that viewer. For example, if you have `feh` installed, you can use:

```zsh
feh image.png
```

Alternatively, if you want a lightweight terminal-based PNG viewer, you can use `fim`:

```zsh
fim image.png
```

Make sure to replace `image.png` with the actual path to your PNG file.
