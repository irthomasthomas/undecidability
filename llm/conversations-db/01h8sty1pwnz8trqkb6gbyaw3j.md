**Prompt:**
## USER
What is self documenting code?

## ASSISTANT
Self-documenting code is code that is written in such a way that it is easy to understand and does not require extensive documentation in order to be understood. This can be achieved through the use of clear and descriptive names for variables, functions, and other elements of the code, as well as the use of comments and other documentation within the code itself. One of the primary benefits of self-documenting code is that it can make it easier for other developers to understand and maintain the code, which can save time and reduce the risk of errors. 

## USER
Which programming languages are best for writing self documenting code. Which languages are the least suitable?

## ASSISTANT
It is generally easier to write self-documenting code in languages that have clear and consistent syntax and conventions, and that provide features such as descriptive variable and function names, and clear commenting. Some examples of languages that are often considered good for writing self-documenting code include Python, Java, and C#.

On the other hand, some languages may be more difficult to write self-documenting code in due to their syntax or other features. For example, languages with very terse syntax, such as assembly language or golfing languages, may not provide as many opportunities for adding descriptive names or comments, which can make the code more difficult to understand. Ultimately, the suitability of a language for writing self-documenting code will depend on the specific needs and preferences of the developer.

## USER
Which programming languages have the best chance of replacing python in the next decade?

## ASSISTANT
It is difficult to predict with certainty which programming languages will gain widespread adoption in the future, as the popularity of programming languages can be influenced by a variety of factors, including the requirements of particular domains, the availability of supporting tools and libraries, and the preferences of developers.

That being said, there are a number of programming languages that have gained significant traction in recent years and could potentially pose a challenge to Python's popularity in the future. Some examples include:

- Rust: A systems programming language that is designed to be safe, concurrent, and fast. Rust has been growing in popularity due to its strong safety guarantees and performance, and has been used in a wide range of applications, including web development, systems programming, and data analysis.

- Julia: A high-level, high-performance programming language for numerical and scientific computing. Julia has a syntax that is similar to Python, but is designed to be faster and more expressive, and has a growing ecosystem of libraries and tools.

- Kotlin: A statically-typed programming language that is fully interoperable with Java and is designed to be more concise and expressive. Kotlin has become increasingly popular as a substitute for Java in the Android ecosystem, and has also been used in other contexts, such as web development and data science.

Again, it is difficult to predict with certainty which languages will gain widespread adoption in the future, and Python is likely to remain a popular and influential language for the foreseeable future.

## USER
Tel me the brief history of kotlin. Be concise and accurate, and check your facts.

## ASSISTANT
Kotlin is a statically-typed programming language that was developed by JetBrains, a software development company based in Russia. It was first announced in 2011, and the first stable version was released in 2016.

One of the main goals of Kotlin was to improve upon the features of the Java language, which is a popular language for developing Android apps. Kotlin is fully interoperable with Java and is designed to be more concise and expressive, while still being compatible with the Java ecosystem.

Since its initial release, Kotlin has gained widespread adoption, particularly in the Android ecosystem. In 2017, Google announced that Kotlin would be an officially supported language for Android development, which has contributed to its growing popularity. Kotlin is now used in a wide range of contexts, including web development and data science. Think it through carefully. Bellow is content of markdown file. Write a linux comand to output all user lines and everything before the next ASSISTANT line

**Response:**
The command below will output all the lines starting from a line with 'USER' until a line with 'ASSISTANT' in a markdown file:

```bash
sed -n -e '/^## USER/,/^## ASSISTANT/p' markdown_file.md
```

Here:

- `sed` is a stream editor for filtering and transforming text.
- `-n` option tells sed to suppress automatic printing of pattern space.
- `-e` option allows you to add the script directly in the command line.
- `/^## USER/,/^## ASSISTANT/p` is the actual sed command which prints every line (/p) from the line starting with '## USER' (/^## USER/) up to, but not including, the line starting with '## ASSISTANT' (/^## ASSISTANT/). 

This command will also include the '## USER' and '## ASSISTANT' lines in the output.
  
Please note that this command assumes that '## USER' and '## ASSISTANT' are at the starts of the lines. The '^' symbol tells the command to match the beginning of a line. In addition, this command works for the specific question in mentioned context, and for different contexts or use cases, modification might be required.
