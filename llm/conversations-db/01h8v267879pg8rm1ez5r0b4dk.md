**Prompt:**
escape a : character in yaml

**Response:**
To escape a `:` character in yaml, you can enclose the value containing the `:` character within single quotation marks `'` or double quotation marks `"`. 

For example, consider the following YAML snippet:

```yaml
key: 'value:with:colon'
```

In this case, the value `value:with:colon` is enclosed within single quotation marks, which allows the `:` characters to be treated as part of the value rather than as a delimiter.

Alternatively, you could enclose the value within double quotation marks as well:

```yaml
key: "value:with:colon"
```

Both approaches will escape the `:` character within the YAML document.
