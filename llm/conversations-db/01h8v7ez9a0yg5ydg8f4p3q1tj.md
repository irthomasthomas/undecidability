**Prompt:**
What is the exact zsh command to: detect when an terminal command returned an error, then save the command and the ouput, and print them to the terminal. script should run in background of current terminal session?


**Response:**
You can use the `trap` command in zsh to detect when a command returns an error. Here is a script that does what you asked:

```zsh
# Start a subshell
(
  # Redirect all output to a file
  exec > >(tee command_output.txt) 2>&1

  # Define a function to execute on error
  trap 'echo "Command failed: $BASH_COMMAND"' ERR

  # Run commands
  your_command_here
) &
```

Replace `your_command_here` with the command you want to run. This script will run in the background of the current terminal session, save the command and its output to a file named `command_output.txt`, and print them to the terminal. If the command returns an error, it will print a message to the terminal.
