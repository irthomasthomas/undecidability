**Prompt:**
Think it through carefully. How to trap errors in a terminal session for both bash and zsh?

**Response:**
Trapping errors in a terminal session for both bash and zsh is a way to handle unexpected situations in your scripts. You can use the `trap` command to specify which commands to run when a certain signal is received by your script.

Here's a basic example of how to trap errors:

```bash
#!/bin/bash

# Define a function to handle the error
handle_error() {
  echo "An error occurred on line $1 of the script"
  exit 1
}

# Use the trap command to catch errors (signal ERR) and call the handle_error function
trap 'handle_error $LINENO' ERR

# The rest of your script goes here...
```

In this script, if any command returns a non-zero exit status (which signals an error in Unix-like systems), the `handle_error` function will be called with the current line number as an argument.

This works the same way in zsh as it does in bash.

Note: The `trap` command can also catch other signals, not just errors. For example, you can use it to ensure that your script cleans up after itself if it's killed or interrupted. For more information, check the man page for `trap` (`man trap` in your terminal).

Also, remember that this will not catch all types of errors. For example, it won't catch syntax errors in your script. Those need to be caught and fixed during the development and testing of the script.
