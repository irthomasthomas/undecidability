**Prompt:**
Think it through carefully. Write the algorithm first. A script to trap all errors in a terminal session for both bash and zsh. So that any time I issue a command and it causes an error, the command and the output can be saved for analysis


**Response:**
This script will capture all the commands you have executed and their output in a log file. It will work for both bash and zsh shell. 

Please follow these steps:

1. Create a script with the filename `trap_errors.sh`:

```bash
#!/bin/bash

# The name of the log file
LOGFILE="$HOME/error_log.txt"

# Function to log the error
log_error() {
    local ERR="$?"
    # If the last command was successful, don't log anything
    if [ "$ERR" = "0" ]; then
        return 0
    fi

    # Get the last command executed
    local COMMAND=$(fc -ln -1)
    # Remove leading spaces
    COMMAND=${COMMAND##*}

    # Log the error
    echo "Command: $COMMAND" >> "$LOGFILE"
    echo "Error Code: $ERR" >> "$LOGFILE"
    echo "Timestamp: $(date)" >> "$LOGFILE"
    echo "-------------------------" >> "$LOGFILE"
}

# Trap ERR signal and call our error logging function
trap 'log_error' ERR

# Start a new shell so that we can keep trapping errors
$SHELL
```

2. Make the script executable:

```bash
chmod +x trap_errors.sh
```

3. Run the script:

```bash
./trap_errors.sh
```

Now, any command that fails will have its details logged in `~/error_log.txt`. You can change the location of the log file by modifying the `LOGFILE` variable at the top of the script.

Please note that this script will only log errors from commands that are run after the script is started. If you want to log errors from all commands, you would need to add the `trap 'log_error' ERR` line to your `.bashrc` or `.zshrc` file, and define the `log_error` function there as well.

**Prompt:**
what does a value of 5 mean for jq return code?

**Response:**
The return code of 5 from `jq` indicates that there was an error such as "Out of memory", "Cannot open file", "Incorrect JSON", or "Unexpected error". If you see return code 5, generally there will be a corresponding error message on the stderr that would provide more details about the fault. Unfortunately, the return codes in `jq` are not well-documented, so it's often best to rely on the stderr output to understand what went wrong.
