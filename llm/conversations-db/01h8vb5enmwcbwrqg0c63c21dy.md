**Prompt:**
Think carefully. If a command in my zsh terminal returns an error, keep a copy of the error message and return code

**Response:**
To keep a copy of the error message and return code, you can redirect the output (both stdout and stderr) to a file. You can also print the return code to the same file. Here's how you can do it:

```bash
command 2>&1 | tee error.log
echo "Return code: $?" | tee -a error.log
```

In this example, `command` is the command you're running. Replace it with the actual command you're using.

Here's what each part does:

- `2>&1` redirects stderr (2) to stdout (1). This means both the regular output and error messages will be sent to the next command.
- `|` pipes the output to the next command.
- `tee error.log` writes the output to a file named `error.log` and also prints it to the screen.
- `echo "Return code: $?"` prints the return code of the last command. `$?` is a special variable that holds the return code of the last command.
- `tee -a error.log` appends the output to `error.log` without overwriting the previous contents.

This will create a file named `error.log` in the current directory. If the file already exists, it will append to it. If you want to overwrite the file each time, use `tee error.log` without the `-a` option in the second command.

**Prompt:**
but the return code will be for the tee command?

**Response:**
Yes, you're correct. The `$?` in the command I gave will contain the return code of the `tee` command, not the original command. My apologies for any confusion caused.

One way to log the original command's error message and return code is by using a sub-shell. Here's how you can do it:

```bash
(command; echo "Exit status: $?") | tee error.log
```

This will execute your command in a sub-shell, and then print out it's exit status with "Exit Status: $?". The round brackets, `()`, are used to create a sub-shell. Then the output from the sub-shell is piped to `tee` which will store the output in `error.log` and also print it out to the console.

Replace `command` with the command you want to run. This will properly log the output and exit status of the command you're running.

Here's an example using `ls` on a non-existing directory:

```bash
(ls /some/non/existing/directory; echo "Exit status: $?") | tee error.log
```

**Prompt:**
now how do I combine the input command, response code for our command, and the output message in one?

**Response:**
Sure, you can use 'set -x' to print the command being executed, '$?' to print the exit status and direct both stdout and stderr to the tee command as follows:

```bash
( set -x ; command 2>&1 ; echo "Exit status: $?" ) | tee error.log
```

In this example, replace 'command' with the actual command you want to execute. The 'set -x' command prints each command that is going to be executed to the terminal, '2>&1' is used to direct both stdout and stderr, 'echo "Exit status: $?"' will print the return status of the executed command, and eventually all of these outputs are piped to 'tee' command.

Here's an example using 'ls /non_existent_directory':

```bash
( set -x ; ls /non_existent_directory 2>&1 ; echo "Exit status: $?" ) | tee error.log
```
