 what jq commands use explore this data? is there a jq command I can use first to instruct me on the querys to use on this ?

**Response:**
You can use the following jq commands to explore this data:

1. To pretty-print the JSON:
```bash
jq '.' filename.json
```
2. To get keys at the top level:
```bash
jq 'keys' filename.json
```
3. To get keys at nested levels:
```bash
jq '.[] | keys' filename.json
```
4. To access a specific field, like `id`:
```bash
jq '.[].id' filename.json
```

First, you need to understand the structure of your json, which you can do by simply running jq '.' to pretty print the json. Then you can use 'keys' to get an array of key names at any level. Once you know the key names, you can construct your queries. 

Remember to replace `filename.json` with the path to your actual JSON file.

Explanation:

- `.`: is the most basic filter, and is very useful because it generates the entire input JSON.
- `keys`: gives the names of all the keys in the input JSON in an array, sorted in lexicographically increasing order.
- `.[].key_name`: access the value of a specific key 'key_name' for each object in the array.
- `|`: is the pipe operator, you can feed the output of one filter as the input into another using it. It works analogously to a unix pipe. 

Remember that jq expressions are case-sensitive, so ensure you're using the exact casing as it is in the JSON file you're exploring. For nested objects replace 'key_name' with the path to the nested key, like '.[0].nested_key'. 

Note: Queries mentioned are general purpose, please modify the keys and indices according to your json data.
