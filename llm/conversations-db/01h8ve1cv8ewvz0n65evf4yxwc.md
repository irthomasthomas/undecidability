 Write a long list of jq commands and pipeline use cases

**Response:**
Here is a list of various `jq` commands and pipeline use cases:

1. Pretty-print the JSON: 
    ```
    jq '.' filename.json
    ```
2. Get keys at the top level: 
    ```
    jq 'keys' filename.json
    ```
3. Get keys at nested levels:
    ```
    jq '.[] | keys' filename.json
    ```
4. Access a specific field, like `id`:
    ```
    jq '.[].id' filename.json
    ```
5. Access a nested field, like `id` inside `inner_object`:
    ```
    jq '.[].inner_object.id' filename.json
    ```
6. Filter objects in an array where a field matches a value:
    ```
    jq '.[] | select(.id == "desired_id")' filename.json
    ```
7. Filter objects and output only the fields you're interested in:
    ```
    jq '.[] | {id: .id, name: .name}' filename.json
    ```
8. Count the number of items in an array:
    ```
    jq 'length' filename.json
    ```
9. Join elements of an array into a string:
    ```
    jq '[.[] | .name] | join(", ")' filename.json
    ```
10. Group elements by a field:
    ```
    jq 'group_by(.type)' filename.json
    ```
11. Use map to transform an array of objects:
    ```
    jq 'map({key: .id, value: .name})' filename.json
    ```
12. Create a map from an array of objects (key/value must be present in each object):
    ```
    jq 'map({(.key): .value}) | add' filename.json
    ```
13. Access and filter nested arrays:
    ```
    jq '.[] | .nested_array[] | select(. == "desired_value")' filename.json
    ```
14. Get unique elements in an array: 
    ```
    jq '[.[]] | unique' filename.json
    ```
15. Sort an array of objects based on a field: 
    ```
    jq 'sort_by(.field)' filename.json
    ```
16. Reverse an array:
    ```
    jq 'reverse' filename.json
    ```
These are basic examples of how you can use `jq` to query JSON data and construct useful pipelines. Replace `filename.json` with your actual JSON file, and field names with the actual keys in your JSON structure. You might need to adapt these examples to your specific use case and JSON structure.
