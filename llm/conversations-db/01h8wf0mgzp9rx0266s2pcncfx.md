**Prompt:**
search my stars and clone a repo

**Response:**
To search your starred repositories and clone a specific repo, you can use the following command:

```shell
gh s -E -u @me | xargs -n1 gh repo clone
```

This command will search your starred repositories using the "gh s" command and then pipe the URL of each repository to "xargs," which will clone the repository using the "gh repo clone" command.

Make sure you have the GitHub CLI (gh) installed and authenticated before running this command.
