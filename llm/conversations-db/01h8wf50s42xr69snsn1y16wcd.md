**Prompt:**
search my forks

**Response:**
To search for your forks on GitHub, you can use the following command:

```
gh s -E -u @me -F
```

This command uses the `-F` flag to filter the search results and only show your forked repositories. The `-E` flag is used to perform an exact matching search, and the `-u @me` flag is used to search for repositories owned by you.
