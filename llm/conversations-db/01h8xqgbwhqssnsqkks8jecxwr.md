**Prompt:**
QNA for productive open-source: How do you organise /your repos/, /their repos/, /your forks of their repos?/ in your linux desktop?

**Response:**
Q: How do I organize my repositories on my Linux desktop?
A: You may want to consider creating folders for each of your projects on your desktop. These folders can then contain the specific repositories related to each project. For example, you can have a "Dev" folder that contains sub-folders for "Project1," "Project2," etc., each containing appropriate repositories.

Q: How do I organize other persons' repositories on my Linux desktop?
A: It's recommended to maintain a separate folder dedicated to other persons' repositories. This can then be organized by the author's name or the project it's related to. This can help prevent any mix-up between your work and others.

Q: How do I organise my forks of their repos on my Linux desktop?
A: Ideally, forks of other repositories should be kept in another separate directory. It could be inside the original author's directory in a dedicated "Forks" folder. This makes sure everything remains organized and encapsulated within its own workspace. 

It's crucial to keep in mind that the ultimate organization of all these will largely depend on personal preferences and what optimally supports your workflow.
