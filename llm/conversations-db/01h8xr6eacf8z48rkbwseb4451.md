**Prompt:**
Physics: what is h bar?

**Response:**
In physics, ħ (pronounced "h-bar") is a fundamental constant known as the reduced Planck constant. It is defined as the ratio of the Planck constant (h) to 2π. The Planck constant (h) is a fundamental constant that relates the energy of a photon to its frequency, and it plays a crucial role in quantum mechanics.

The reduced Planck constant (ħ) is often used in quantum mechanics to simplify mathematical expressions and equations. It has dimensions of angular momentum and is commonly used to represent the quantization of physical quantities such as angular momentum, energy, and action.

The value of ħ is approximately 1.05457182 × 10^(-34) joule-seconds or 6.62607015 × 10^(-34) joule-seconds, depending on the unit system used.
