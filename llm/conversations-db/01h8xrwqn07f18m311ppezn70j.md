**Prompt:**
Explain: chmod 700 filename

**Response:**
The command "chmod 700 filename" is used in UNIX-like operating systems to change the permissions of a file named "filename". Here's a breakdown of what each part means:

- "chmod" is short for "change mode". It's a command used to modify the file permissions.
- "700" is the numerical representation of the permissions to be set. In this case, the digits are split into three parts: the first digit corresponds to the owner's permissions, the second digit to the group's permissions, and the third digit to others' permissions.
- The value "7" represents full permissions, which includes read, write, and execute permissions.
- "0" means no permissions are granted.

So, "chmod 700 filename" sets the file permissions as follows:

- The owner of the file has full permissions (read, write, and execute).
- The group and other users have no permissions.

In other words, only the owner can read from, write to, or execute the file, while group and other users have no access to it.

**Prompt:**
how do I remove the owner, too?

**Response:**
To remove the owner's permissions and make the file inaccessible to anyone, you can use the "chmod 000 filename" command. This command sets the permissions as follows:

- The owner of the file has no permissions.
- The group has no permissions.
- Other users have no permissions.

With these permissions, neither the owner, group, nor other users can access or modify the file. It effectively removes all access to the file.
