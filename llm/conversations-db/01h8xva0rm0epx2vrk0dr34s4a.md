**Prompt:**
EXplain: tar -czvf archive_name.tar.gz directory_name

**Response:**
The command "tar -czvf archive_name.tar.gz directory_name" is used to create a compressed archive file of a specific directory in Linux. Let's break down the command:

- "tar" is the program used for creating and manipulating archive files.
- "-c" stands for "create," indicating that we want to create a new archive.
- "-z" specifies that we want to compress the archive using gzip.
- "-v" enables verbose mode, which displays the progress and details of the archiving process.
- "-f" indicates that the following argument will be the name of the archive file to be created.

In this case, "archive_name.tar.gz" is the name of the archive file we want to create. The extension ".tar.gz" represents a TAR archive that is compressed using gzip. You can choose any name for your archive.

Lastly, "directory_name" is the name of the directory that you want to include in the archive. This can be replaced with the actual directory path if you are not in the same directory as the one you want to archive.

By running this command, a TAR archive file named "archive_name.tar.gz" will be created, containing all the files and subdirectories within the specified "directory_name." The archive will be compressed using gzip, resulting in a smaller file size.
