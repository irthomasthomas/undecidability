**Prompt:**
Write a list of the most advanced features of ZSH and deep features. And any statistics and history records it keeps

**Response:**
1. Advanced Autocompletion: ZSH includes an autocompletion mechanism much more advanced and customizable than that found in Bash or Tcsh; it suggests possible completions as you type.

2. Extended File Globbing: ZSH allows for more advanced pattern definitions in a process known as globbing. This includes recursive globbing. For instance, you can use commands that operate on a set of files that match a certain pattern.

3. Named Directories: ZSH allows you to store commonly used directories in named parameters.

4. History expansion: ZSH supports sharing history between all running shells, viewing detailed history, and ignoring duplicates entries.

5. Command Correction: ZSH has a built-in spell checker that can catch and correct command typos.

6. Line Editing: ZSH enables multiline command editing. 

7. Advanced Variable Array: ZSH allows for the manipulation of array variables, including concatenation, merging, and reversing.

8. Advanced Prompt Customization: ZHS supports prompt themes and customizations, including colors, completion status, etc.

9. Loadable Modules: ZSH allows for adding new commands and extending its functionalities with loadable modules.

10. Theme and Plugin Support: ZSH has a dedicated community that contributes to a variety of open-source themes and plugins. Also, Oh My Zsh, a framework designed for managing ZSH configurations, comes with bundles of helpful functions, helpers, plugins, and themes.

Regarding statistics and history records, ZSH keeps:

1. Type History: ZSH maintains the history of all the commands entered in the shell.

2. Shared History: ZSH allows sharing history between all active sessions. 

3. Detailed History: ZSH can be configured to maintain a history file with timestamped entries, which allows a user to see exactly when a command was executed. 

4. History Search: ZSH provides an ability to incremental search through history.

As for history, ZSH (Z shell) was first released by Paul Falstad in 1990, and the latest version 5.8 was released in February 2020. It has now become a popular shell due to its features focusing on usability.
 
Please note that the actual ability of ZSH to manage history and statistics may depend on the user configuration and system settings.

**Prompt:**
Can I configure zsh, or write a custom script, so that all cli tools I call or built-ins are recorded so I can see how frequently I use them

**Response:**
Yes, ZSH already has the built-in capability to record the history of commands you've used in a file, usually named `.zsh_history` in your home directory. This history file includes both built-in commands and any command line tools you've used.

However, if you want to analyze this data to view the frequency of command usage, you would need to write a custom script or use some existing tools.

Here is a simple example of a command you can run in your terminal that reads the history and sorts it according to usage frequency:

```shell
cat ~/.zsh_history | cut -d ';' -f 2 | awk '{CMD[$1]++;count++;}END { for (a in CMD)print CMD[a] " " CMD[a]/count*100 "% " a;}' | grep -v "./" | column -c3 -s " " -t | sort -nr | nl |  head -n10
```

let's break it down:

1. `cat ~/.zsh_history`: Cat command is used to read the content of the history file.

2. `cut -d ';' -f 2`: This cuts the command part out of the history record.

3. `awk '{CMD[$1]++;count++;}END { for (a in CMD)print CMD[a] " " CMD[a]/count*100 "% " a;}'`: This command calculates the frequency and percentage of each command.

4. `grep -v "./"`: This gets rid of any entries that were executed in the current directory.

5. `column -c3 -s " " -t | sort -nr | nl | head -n10`: These commands are used to format, sort the data and get the top 10 command list.

Please note that you might need to adjust the script depending on the specific format of your history file and the way you want the output to be structured. Writing more complex scripts or programs to parse and analyze this data is definitely possible if you have specific requirements.
