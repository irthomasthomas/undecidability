**Prompt:**
Think carefully. In manjaro (arch) linux terminal, covert markdown doc to plain text

**Response:**
To convert a Markdown document to plain text in Manjaro (Arch) Linux terminal, you can use pandoc, a universal document converter. 

Here are the steps in terminal:

1. If it's not yet installed, install pandoc using pacman by typing: 
```
sudo pacman -S pandoc
```

2. To convert a Markdown document to plain text, use the following command:
```
pandoc -s -o output.txt input.md
```

In the above command, replace "input.md" with your markdown file, and "output.txt" with the desired plain text file name. The `-s` flag is for 'standalone', which produces output with an appropriate header and footer (e.g. a set of HTML tags enclosing the body). 

Just keep in mind that Markdown-specific formatting will not be present in the plain text file and you might need to do some post-processing to ensure the formatting is as you want it.
