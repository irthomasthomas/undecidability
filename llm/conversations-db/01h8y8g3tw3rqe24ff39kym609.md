"Request: " view my own repos ordered by new


**Response:**
To view your own repositories ordered by new, you can use the `gh repo list` command with the `--sort` flag set to `created`. Here's how you can do it:

```bash
gh repo list --sort created
```

This command will list your repositories and sort them by the creation date, with the newest ones appearing first.
