"Request: " view my own repos ordered by new


**Response:**
To view your own repositories ordered by when they were created, you can use the GitHub CLI's `gh repo list` command with the `--sort` flag set to "created":

```bash
gh repo list @me --limit 1000 --sort created
```

This command lists your repositories, with a limit of 1000 repositories and sorting them by when they were created. The `@me` option refers to your GitHub user's repositories.

Unfortunately, GitHub CLI does not currently support sorting in descending order (newest first) directly. The repositories are displayed in ascending order (oldest first). To reverse the order to show the newest repositories first, you will need to use a separate command such as `tac` (available on Unix-like systems) or `tail -r` (on macOS):

```bash
gh repo list @me --limit 1000 --sort created | tac
```

or

```bash
gh repo list @me --limit 1000 --sort created | tail -r
```

Remember, you need to have the GitHub CLI installed and configured with your GitHub account to run these commands. You can download and install it from the official [GitHub CLI website](https://cli.github.com/).
