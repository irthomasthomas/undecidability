**Prompt:**
In ZSH on Manjaro, use the github api to return a list of my repositories sorted by new

**Response:**
You can use the GitHub API to get a sorted list of your repositories. Make sure you replace 'myusername' with your actual GitHub username and add your token in the command below:

```zsh
curl -H "Authorization: token YOUR_GITHUB_TOKEN" 'https://api.github.com/users/myusername/repos?type=owner&sort=created' | jq -r '.[] | .name'
```

This will return a list of all your repositories sorted by creation date in ascending order (oldest first). 

If you want them in descending order (newest first), you can use 'tac' command to reverse the output. Here is the adjusted command:

```zsh
curl -H "Authorization: token YOUR_GITHUB_TOKEN" 'https://api.github.com/users/myusername/repos?type=owner&sort=created' | jq -r '.[] | .name' | tac
```

Please note that you have to have the 'jq' software (a lightweight and flexible command-line JSON processor) installed on your system to use this command. If you don't have it installed, you can install it using your package manager (in Manjaro, this would typically be pacman):

```zsh
sudo pacman -S jq
```
