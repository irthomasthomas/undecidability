 can I automatically remove all but a small subset of apps, for a while, and then restore them again?

**Response:**
Yes, you can use the `xdg-desktop-menu` command line tool to uninstall and install desktop menu items, which includes applications. You can uninstall a subset of apps by specifying the corresponding desktop files, and later restore them by reinstalling those desktop files.

To uninstall apps:
```
xdg-desktop-menu uninstall directory-file(s) desktop-file(s)
```
Replace `directory-file(s)` and `desktop-file(s)` with the paths to the directories and desktop files of the apps you want to uninstall.

To reinstall apps:
```
xdg-desktop-menu install directory-file(s) desktop-file(s)
```
Again, replace `directory-file(s)` and `desktop-file(s)` with the paths to the directories and desktop files of the apps you want to reinstall.

Remember that this tool affects the desktop menu items, not necessarily the entire installed applications.
