 Write a bash script to stash the current desktop applications menu items. Install a smaller sub-set, and allow the user to restore the full menu later. Minimize useless branching and process execution. Think it through carefully

**Response:**
Here is a simple bash script that does what you asked for. It first stashes the current desktop applications menu items, then installs a smaller subset, and finally allows the user to restore the full menu later.

```bash
#!/bin/bash

# Define the directory where the menu items are stored
MENU_DIR="/usr/share/applications"

# Define the directory to stash the current menu items
STASH_DIR="$HOME/.menu_stash"

# Define the subset of menu items to install
SUBSET=("firefox.desktop" "gnome-terminal.desktop")

# Create the stash directory if it doesn't exist
mkdir -p $STASH_DIR

# Function to stash the current menu items
stash_menu() {
    echo "Stashing current menu items..."
    cp $MENU_DIR/*.desktop $STASH_DIR/
}

# Function to install a subset of menu items
install_subset() {
    echo "Installing subset of menu items..."
    rm $MENU_DIR/*.desktop
    for item in "${SUBSET[@]}"; do
        cp $STASH_DIR/$item $MENU_DIR/
    done
}

# Function to restore the full menu
restore_menu() {
    echo "Restoring full menu..."
    cp $STASH_DIR/*.desktop $MENU_DIR/
}

# Check the command line argument
if [ "$1" == "stash" ]; then
    stash_menu
elif [ "$1" == "install" ]; then
    install_subset
elif [ "$1" == "restore" ]; then
    restore_menu
else
    echo "Usage: $0 {stash|install|restore}"
fi
```

To use this script, save it to a file, make it executable with `chmod +x filename`, and run it with one of the following commands:

- `./filename stash` to stash the current menu items.
- `./filename install` to install the subset of menu items.
- `./filename restore` to restore the full menu.

Note: This script assumes that the menu items are stored in `/usr/share/applications` and that the user has the necessary permissions to read and write files in this directory. If this is not the case, you may need to adjust the script accordingly.
