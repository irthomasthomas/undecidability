 Write an algorithm to help me program this:\n I want to use the quickest path to add a GUI function. \n - The GUI should display a grid of applications.\n - It should accept a full_app_list and suggested_app_list as input.\n Pre-select the applications from the suggested_app_list.\n - Let the user select or de-select the apps they want, then return the user_apps_list

**Response:**
Algorithm for adding a GUI function:

1. Define a function called "create_gui" that takes two parameters:
   - full_app_list: a list of all available applications
   - suggested_app_list: a list of pre-selected applications

2. Create a GUI window with a grid layout to display the applications. Set the window title as "Application Selection".

3. Create check boxes for each application in the full_app_list. If the application is in the suggested_app_list, set the check box as pre-selected.

4. Add a "Select All" button to select all applications in the full_app_list.

5. Add a "Deselect All" button to deselect all applications.

6. Add a "Submit" button to finalize the selection and close the window.

7. Add a "Cancel" button to cancel the selection process and close the window.

8. Define a function called "get_user_apps_list" that takes no parameters.

9. Inside the "get_user_apps_list" function, initialize an empty list called "user_apps_list".

10. Call the "create_gui" function, passing the full_app_list and suggested_app_list as parameters.

11. When the user clicks the "Submit" button, iterate over all the check boxes and check if they are selected.

12. If a check box is selected, add the corresponding application to the "user_apps_list".

13. Close the GUI window.

14. Return the "user_apps_list" from the "get_user_apps_list" function.

15. In your main script, call the "get_user_apps_list" function to retrieve the user's selected applications.
