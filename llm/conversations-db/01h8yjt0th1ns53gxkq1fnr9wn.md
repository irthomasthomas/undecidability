**Prompt:**
1. Define a function called "create_gui" that takes two parameters:
   - full_app_list: a list of all available applications
   - suggested_app_list: a list of pre-selected applications

2. Create a GUI window with a grid layout to display the applications. Set the window title as "Application Selection".

3. Create check boxes for each application in the full_app_list. If the application is in the suggested_app_list, set the check box as pre-selected.

4. Add a "Select All" button to select all applications in the full_app_list.

5. Add a "Deselect All" button to deselect all applications.

6. Add a "Submit" button to finalize the selection and close the window.

7. Add a "Cancel" button to cancel the selection process and close the window.

8. Define a function called "get_user_apps_list" that takes no parameters.

9. Inside the "get_user_apps_list" function, initialize an empty list called "user_apps_list".

10. Call the "create_gui" function, passing the full_app_list and suggested_app_list as parameters.

11. When the user clicks the "Submit" button, iterate over all the check boxes and check if they are selected.

12. If a check box is selected, add the corresponding application to the "user_apps_list".

13. Close the GUI window.

14. Return the "user_apps_list" from the "get_user_apps_list" function.

15. In your main script, call the "get_user_apps_list" function to retrieve the user's selected applications.
 Write the code to achieve this in the most performant and portable way. Minimise branching and subshells. Minimize dependencies. Proceed with the same.

**Response:**
Here is the code to achieve the requirements mentioned above:

```python
import tkinter as tk

def create_gui(full_app_list, suggested_app_list):
    def select_all():
        for app in app_checkboxes:
            app_checkboxes[app].select()
    
    def deselect_all():
        for app in app_checkboxes:
            app_checkboxes[app].deselect()
    
    def submit_selection():
        for app in app_checkboxes:
            if app_checkboxes[app].get() == 1:
                user_apps_list.append(app)
        root.destroy()
    
    def cancel_selection():
        root.destroy()
    
    root = tk.Tk()
    root.title("Application Selection")
    
    app_checkboxes = {}
    for app in full_app_list:
        selected = 1 if app in suggested_app_list else 0
        app_checkboxes[app] = tk.Checkbutton(root, text=app, variable=tk.IntVar(value=selected))
        app_checkboxes[app].grid(sticky="w")
    
    select_all_button = tk.Button(root, text="Select All", command=select_all)
    select_all_button.grid(sticky="w")

    deselect_all_button = tk.Button(root, text="Deselect All", command=deselect_all)
    deselect_all_button.grid(sticky="w")

    submit_button = tk.Button(root, text="Submit", command=submit_selection)
    submit_button.grid(sticky="w")

    cancel_button = tk.Button(root, text="Cancel", command=cancel_selection)
    cancel_button.grid(sticky="w")
    
    root.mainloop()

def get_user_apps_list():
    user_apps_list = []
    create_gui(full_app_list, suggested_app_list)
    return user_apps_list

full_app_list = ["App1", "App2", "App3", "App4", "App5"]
suggested_app_list = ["App2", "App4"]

user_selected_apps = get_user_apps_list()
print(user_selected_apps)
```

This code creates a GUI window using the `tkinter` library with a grid layout.

The `create_gui` function creates check boxes for each application in the `full_app_list` and sets the check boxes as pre-selected if the application is in the `suggested_app_list`.

The `select_all` function selects all the check boxes, the `deselect_all` function deselects all check boxes, the `submit_selection` function adds the selected applications to the `user_apps_list` and closes the GUI window, and the `cancel_selection` function simply closes the GUI window.

The `get_user_apps_list` function initializes an empty `user_apps_list`, calls the `create_gui` function to display the application selection window, and returns the `user_apps_list` after the selection is finalized.

In the main script, the `get_user_apps_list` function is called to retrieve the user's selected applications, and the selected applications are then printed.

**Prompt:**
Change install_subset so that it always calls stash first

**Response:**
To ensure that `stash` is always called before `install_subset`, we can modify the `install_subset` function as follows:

```bash
install_subset() {
  stash
  handle_dependencies
  download_subset
  install_packages
}
```

By moving the `stash` command to the beginning of the `install_subset` function, we can ensure that it is always called before proceeding with the remaining steps.
