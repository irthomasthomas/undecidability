   mode] directory-file(s) desktop-file(s)

   xdg-desktop-menu uninstall [--noupdate] [--mode mode]

 Think it through carefully. Write the algorith first. Create a bash app that lets the user stash their current applications menu items, install a smaller subset, then restore the original state later. Think about the simplest and most logical structure. Minimize code duplication, branching and process spawning.

**Response:**
To create a bash app that allows the user to stash, install, and restore application menu items, we can follow the following algorithm:

1. Prompt the user to enter their choice.
2. If the user chooses 'stash', execute the following steps:
   a. Create a backup directory to store the current application menu items.
   b. Copy all the desktop files from the system menu directories to the backup directory.
   c. Notify the user that the backup process is completed.
3. If the user chooses 'install', execute the following steps:
   a. Prompt the user to enter the directory or directories containing the new menu items.
   b. Copy the desktop files from the provided directory to the system menu directories.
   c. Notify the user that the installation process is completed.
4. If the user chooses 'restore', execute the following steps:
   a. Restore the original application menu items from the backup directory to the system menu directories.
   b. Notify the user that the restoration process is completed.
5. If the user chooses 'exit', terminate the bash app.
6. If the user enters an invalid choice, display an error message and prompt for a valid choice.

To minimize code duplication, branching, and process spawning, we can create separate functions for each of the steps mentioned above. These functions can be called based on the user's choice, reducing the need for duplicated code and branching.

Additionally, we can use the xdg-desktop-menu command line tool mentioned in the provided information to perform the actual installation, uninstallation, and force update of menu items, reducing the need for manually copying files and handling updates.

Overall, this algorithm provides a simple and logical structure for the bash app while minimizing code duplication and process spawning.

Write the code

**Response:**
Here's an example implementation of the bash app based on the algorithm described above:

```bash
#!/bin/bash

backup_dir="menu_backup"
menu_dirs=(/usr/share/applications /usr/local/share/applications)

stash_menu() {
    echo "Stashing current menu items..."

    # Create backup directory
    mkdir -p "$backup_dir"

    # Copy all desktop files to backup directory
    for dir in "${menu_dirs[@]}"; do
        cp -u "$dir"/*.desktop "$backup_dir"
    done

    echo "Menu items stashed successfully."
}

install_menu() {
    echo "Installing new menu items..."

    read -p "Enter directory path containing new menu items: " new_menu_dir

    # Copy desktop files from new menu directory to system menu directories
    for dir in "${menu_dirs[@]}"; do
        cp "$new_menu_dir"/*.desktop "$dir"
    done

    echo "Menu items installed successfully."
}

restore_menu() {
    echo "Restoring original menu items..."

    # Copy backup files back to system menu directories
    for dir in "${menu_dirs[@]}"; do
        cp -u "$backup_dir"/*.desktop "$dir"
    done

    echo "Menu items restored successfully."
}

# Main loop
while true; do
    echo "Menu items management"
    echo "1. Stash current menu items"
    echo "2. Install a smaller subset of menu items"
    echo "3. Restore original menu items"
    echo "4. Exit"

    read -p "Enter your choice (1-4): " choice

    case $choice in
        1)
            stash_menu
            ;;
        2)
            install_menu
            ;;
        3)
            restore_menu
            ;;
        4)
            exit 0
            ;;
        *)
            echo "Invalid choice. Please enter a number from 1 to 4."
            ;;
    esac
done
```

Please note that this is a basic implementation and may need to be further adapted or enhanced based on specific requirements or considerations for your system.
