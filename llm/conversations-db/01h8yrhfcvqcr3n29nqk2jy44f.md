DESCRIPTION
The xdg-desktop-menu program can be used to install new menu entries
to the desktops application menu.
The application menu works according to the XDG Desktop Menu
Specification at
http://www.freedesktop.org/wiki/Specifications/menu-spec
COMMANDS
install

Install one or more applications in a submenu of the desktop menu
system.
desktop-file: A desktop file represents a single menu entry
in the menu. Desktop files are defined by the freedesktop.org Desktop
Entry Specification. The most important aspects of *.desktop files are
summarized below.
Menu entries can be added to the menu system in two different ways.
They can either be added to a predefined submenu in the menu system
based on one or more category keywords, or they can be added to a new
submenu.
To add a menu entry to a predefined submenu the desktop file that
represents the menu entry must have a Categories= entry that lists one
or more keywords. The menu item will be included in an appropriate
submenu based on the included keywords.
To add menu items to a new submenu the desktop-files must be preceded
by a directory-file that describes the submenu. If multiple
desktop-files are specified, all entries will be added to the same menu.
If entries are installed to a menu that has been created with a previous
call to xdg-desktop-menu the entries will be installed
in addition to any already existing entries.
directory-file: The *.directory file indicated by
directory-file represents a submenu. The directory file
provides the name and icon for a submenu. The name of the directory file
is used to identify the submenu.
If multiple directory files are provided each file will represent a
submenu within the menu that precedes it, creating a nested menu
hierarchy (sub-sub-menus). The menu entries themselves will be added to
the last submenu.
Directory files follow the syntax defined by the freedesktop.org
Desktop Entry Specification.

uninstall

Remove applications or submenus from the desktop menu system
previously installed with xdg-desktop-menu install.
A submenu and the associated directory file is only removed when the
submenu no longer contains any menu entries.

forceupdate

Force an update of the menu system.
This command is only useful if the last call to xdg-desktop-menu
included the --noupdate option.

OPTIONS
--noupdate

Postpone updating the menu system. If multiple updates to the menu
system are made in sequence this flag can be used to indicate that
additional changes will follow and that it is not necessary to update
the menu system right away.

--novendor

Normally, xdg-desktop-menu checks to ensure that any *.directory and
*.desktop files to be installed has a vendor prefix. This option can be
used to disable that check.
A vendor prefix consists of alpha characters ([a-zA-Z]) and is
terminated with a dash ("-"). Companies and organizations are encouraged
to use a word or phrase, preferably the organizations name, for which
they hold a trademark as their vendor prefix. The purpose of the vendor
prefix is to prevent name conflicts.

--mode mode

mode can be user or system. In user mode
the file is (un)installed for the current user only. In system mode the
file is (un)installed for all users on the system. Usually only root is
allowed to install in system mode.
The default is to use system mode when called by root and to use user
mode when called by a non-root user.

--help

Show command synopsis.

--manual

--version

Show the xdg-utils version information.

DESKTOP FILES
An application item in the application menu is represented by a
*.desktop file. A *.desktop file consists of a [Desktop Entry]
header followed by several Key=Value lines.
A *.desktop file can provide a name and description for an
application in several different languages. This is done by adding a
language code as used by LC_MESSAGES in square brackets behind the
Key. This way one can specify different values for the same
Key depending on the currently selected language.
The following keys are often used:
Type=Application

This is a mandatory field that indicates that the *.desktop file
describes an application launcher.

Name=Application Name

The name of the application. For example Mozilla

GenericName=Generic Name

A generic description of the application. For example Web
Browser

Comment=Comment

Optional field to specify a tooltip for the application. For example
Visit websites on the Internet

Icon=Icon File

The icon to use for the application. This can either be an absolute
path to an image file or an icon-name. If an icon-name is provided an
image lookup by name is done in the users current icon theme. The
xdg-icon-resource command can be used to install image
files into icon themes. The advantage of using an icon-name instead of
an absolute path is that with an icon-name the application icon can be
provided in several different sizes as well as in several differently
themed styles.

Exec=Command Line

The command line to start the application. If the application can
open files the %f placeholder should be specified. When a file is
dropped on the application launcher the %f is replaced with the file
path of the dropped file. If multiple files can be specified on the
command line the %F placeholder should be used instead of %f. If the
application is able to open URLs in addition to local files then %u or
%U can be used instead of %f or %F.

Categories=Categories

A list of categories separated by semi-colons. A category is a
keyword that describes and classifies the application. By default
applications are organized in the application menu based on category.
When menu entries are explicitly assigned to a new submenu it is not
necessary to list any categories.
When using categories it is recommended to include one of the
following categories: AudioVideo, Development, Education, Game,
Graphics, Network, Office, Settings, System, Utility.
See Appendix A of the XDG Desktop Menu Specification for information
about additional categories:
http://standards.freedesktop.org/menu-spec/menu-spec-1.0.html#category-registry

MimeType=Mimetypes

A list of mimetypes separated by semi-colons. This field is used to
indicate which file types the application is able to open.

http://www.freedesktop.org/wiki/Specifications/desktop-entry-spec
DIRECTORY FILES
The appearance of submenu in the application menu is provided by a
*.directory file. In particular it provides the title of the submenu and
a possible icon. A *.directory file consists of a [Desktop
Entry] header followed by several Key=Value
lines.
A *.directory file can provide a title (name) for the submenu in
several different languages. This is done by adding a language code as
used by LC_MESSAGES in square brackets behind the Key. This way
one can specify different values for the same Key depending on
the currently selected language.
The following keys are relevant for submenus:
Type=Directory

This is a mandatory field that indicates that the *.directory file
describes a submenu.

Name=Menu Name

The title of submenu. For example Mozilla

Comment=Comment

Optional field to specify a tooltip for the submenu.

Icon=Icon File

The icon to use for the submenu. This can either be an absolute path
to an image file or an icon-name. If an icon-name is provided an image
lookup by name is done in the users current icon theme. The
xdg-icon-resource command can be used to install image
files into icon themes. The advantage of using an icon-name instead of
an absolute path is that with an icon-name the submenu icon can be
provided in several different sizes as well as in several differently
themed styles.

ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES
xdg-desktop-menu honours the following environment variables:
XDG_UTILS_DEBUG_LEVEL

Setting this environment variable to a non-zero numerical value makes
xdg-desktop-menu do more verbose reporting on stderr. Setting a higher
value increases the verbosity.

XDG_UTILS_INSTALL_MODE

This environment variable can be used by the user or administrator to
override the installation mode. Valid values are user and
system.

EXIT CODES
An exit code of 0 indicates success while a non-zero exit code
indicates failure. The following failure codes can be returned:
1

Error in command line syntax.

2

One of the files passed on the command line did not exist.

3

A required tool could not be found.

4

The action failed.

5

No permission to read one of the files passed on the command
line.

EXAMPLES
The company ShinyThings Inc. has developed an application named
"WebMirror" and would like to add it to the application menu. The
company will use "shinythings" as its vendor id. In order to add the
application to the menu there needs to be a .desktop file with a
suitable Categories entry:

shinythings-webmirror.desktop:

  [Desktop Entry]
  Encoding=UTF-8
  Type=Application

  Exec=webmirror
  Icon=webmirror

  Name=WebMirror
  Name[nl]=WebSpiegel

  Categories=Network;WebDevelopment;

Now the xdg-desktop-menu tool can be used to add the
shinythings-webmirror.desktop file to the desktop application menu:

xdg-desktop-menu install ./shinythings-webmirror.desktop

Note that for the purpose of this example the menu items are
available in two languages, English and Dutch. The language code for
Dutch is nl.
In the next example the company ShinyThings Inc. will add its own
submenu to the desktop application menu consisting of a "WebMirror" menu
item and a "WebMirror Admin Tool" menu item.
First the company needs to create two .desktop files that describe
the two menu items. Since the items are to be added to a new submenu it
is not necessary to include a Categories= line:

shinythings-webmirror.desktop:

  [Desktop Entry]
  Encoding=UTF-8
  Type=Application

  Exec=webmirror
  Icon=shinythings-webmirror

  Name=WebMirror
  Name[nl]=WebSpiegel


shinythings-webmirror-admin.desktop:

  [Desktop Entry]
  Encoding=UTF-8
  Type=Application

  Exec=webmirror-admintool
  Icon=shinythings-webmirror-admintool

  Name=WebMirror Admin Tool
  Name[nl]=WebSpiegel Administratie Tool

In addition a .directory file needs to be created to provide a title
and icon for the sub-menu itself:

shinythings-webmirror.directory:

  [Desktop Entry]
  Encoding=UTF-8

  Icon=shinythings-webmirror-menu

  Name=WebMirror
  Name[nl]=WebSpiegel

These file can now be installed with:

xdg-desktop-menu install ./shinythings-webmirror.directory \
      ./shinythings-webmirror.desktop ./shinythings-webmirror-admin.desktop

The menu entries could also be installed one by one:

xdg-desktop-menu install --noupdate ./shinythings-webmirror.directory \
      ./shinythings-webmirror.desktop
xdg-desktop-menu install --noupdate ./shinythings-webmirror.directory \
      ./shinythings-webmirror-admin.desktop
xdg-desktop-menu forceupdate

Although the result is the same it is slightly more efficient to
install all files at the same time.
The *.desktop and *.directory files reference icons with the names
webmirror, webmirror-admin and webmirror-menu which should also be
installed. In this example the icons are installed in two different
sizes, once with a size of 22x22 pixels and once with a size of 64x64
pixels:

xdg-icon-resource install --size 22 ./wmicon-22.png shinythings-webmirror
xdg-icon-resource install --size 22 ./wmicon-menu-22.png shinythings-webmirror-menu
xdg-icon-resource install --size 22 ./wmicon-admin-22.png shinythings-webmirror-admin
xdg-icon-resource install --size 64 ./wmicon-64.png shinythings-webmirror
xdg-icon-resource install --size 64 ./wmicon-menu-64.png shinythings-webmirror-menu
xdg-icon-resource install --size 64 ./wmicon-admin-64.png shinythings-webmirror-admin

Desktop menu specification

 Think it through carefully. Write the algorith first. Create a bash script. Option: 1. Stash the current applications menu.\n 2. Install a smaller subset menu.\n 3. Restore stashed menu.\n Think about the simplest and most logical structure. Minimize code duplication, branching and process spawning.

**Response:**
It seems like you are describing the process of creating a bash script for a menu management tool. The tool should have three options: 1) stash the current applications menu, 2) install a smaller subset menu, and 3) restore the stashed menu. 

To implement this functionality, you can follow these steps:

1. Create a variable to store the path of the current applications menu.
```
current_menu_path="/path/to/current/menu"
```

2. Create a function to stash the current applications menu.
```
stash_menu() {
    cp "$current_menu_path" "$current_menu_path.bak"
}
```

3. Create a function to install a smaller subset menu.
```
install_subset_menu() {
    # Logic to install the smaller subset menu
}
```

4. Create a function to restore the stashed menu.
```
restore_menu() {
    cp "$current_menu_path.bak" "$current_menu_path"
}
```

5. Create a main function that handles the command line options.
```
main() {
    case $1 in
        "--stash") stash_menu ;;
        "--install") install_subset_menu ;;
        "--restore") restore_menu ;;
        *) echo "Invalid option" ;;
    esac
}

# Call the main function with the command line argument
main "$1"
```

6. Save the script in a file, e.g., `menu_management.sh`, and make it executable.
```
chmod +x menu_management.sh
```

Now you can run the script with different options:
```
./menu_management.sh --stash     # Stash the current menu
./menu_management.sh --install   # Install a subset menu
./menu_management.sh --restore   # Restore the stashed menu
```

Remember to replace the line `# Logic to install the smaller subset menu` with the actual logic to install the subset menu according to your requirements.

This bash script provides a basic structure to implement your menu management tool. You can further enhance it by adding error handling, input validation, and additional functionality as needed.
