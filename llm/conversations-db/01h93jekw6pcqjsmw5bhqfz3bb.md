**Prompt:**
zsh: illegal modifier: 0

**Response:**
I apologize for previous wrong responses.

In zsh, !!:1-$ refers to the arguments of the last command, so it doesn't need revising. If there was an error in the command, please provide the complete sequence for further advice.

**Prompt:**
is it possible to get just the paramaters values?

**Response:**
Yes, it's absolutely possible to get just the parameters values using event designators in Zsh. However, !!:1-$ is the correct way to denote 'all arguments of the previous command'. 

If however, you would like to get individual parameters, you can use !!:1, !!:2, etc., where the number corresponds to the position of the parameter in the command. 

In case this doesn't answer your question, could you please provide more details?
