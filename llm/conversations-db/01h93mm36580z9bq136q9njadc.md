**Prompt:**
write some short examples of using $_ in linux terminals and bash scripts

**Response:**
1. To display the contents of the last executed command, you can use `$_` as follows:
```
$ ls -l
total 4
-rw-r--r--  1 user  staff   0 Mar  5 10:51 file.txt
$ echo $_
ls -l
```

2. You can use `$_` to pass the last argument of the previous command to a new command:
```
$ touch newfile.txt
$ mv $_ temp/
# The last argument "newfile.txt" is passed to mv command and it moves the file to "temp" directory
```

3. `$_` can be used in bash scripts to access the last argument passed to the script:
```bash
#!/bin/bash
echo "First argument: $1"
echo "Last argument: $_"
```
```
$ chmod +x script.sh
$ ./script.sh apple banana cherry
First argument: apple
Last argument: cherry
```

4. To repeat the last command with slight modifications, you can utilize `$_` and command substitution:
```
$ echo "Hello, World!"
Hello, World!
$ echo "Goodbye, $(echo $_ | awk '{print $2}')!"
Goodbye, World!
```

5. Using `$_` in a loop to perform an action on each filename in a directory:
```bash
#!/bin/bash
for file in ./*
do
    echo "Processing file: $file"
    # perform some action on $file
done
echo "Last file processed: $_"
```
```
$ chmod +x loop.sh
$ ./loop.sh
Processing file: ./file1.txt
Processing file: ./file2.txt
Processing file: ./file3.txt
Last file processed: ./file3.txt
```

Note: In some shells, `$_` may refer to the last argument of the previous command rather than the last executed command itself. So, it's always a good practice to double-check the behavior in your specific shell.

**Prompt:**
How can view the OUTPUT of the prior command?

**Response:**
To view the output of the prior command in a Linux terminal or bash script, you can use the `$_` variable along with command substitution using `$()` or backticks (` `).
Here is an example:
```bash
$ ls -l file.txt
-rw-r--r--  1 user  staff  0 Mar  5 10:51 file.txt
$ echo "$(echo $_)"
-rw-r--r--  1 user  staff  0 Mar  5 10:51 file.txt
```
In the above example, `$(echo $_)` captures the output of `ls -l file.txt` and `echo "$(echo $_)"` displays the captured output.

**Prompt:**
I do not want to run the command again, only view the response

**Response:**
Apologies for the confusion. To view the response or output of the prior command without re-executing it, you can use the `!!` command substitution or the `history` command.

Using `!!`:
```bash
$ ls -l file.txt
-rw-r--r--  1 user  staff  0 Mar  5 10:51 file.txt
$ echo "$(!!)"
-rw-r--r--  1 user  staff  0 Mar  5 10:51 file.txt
```
In the above example, `!!` is used to refer to the last executed command, and `echo "$(!!)"` captures and displays its output.

Using `history`:
```bash
$ ls -l file.txt
-rw-r--r--  1 user  staff  0 Mar  5 10:51 file.txt
$ history 2 | sed -n '2p' | awk '{$1=""; print $0}'
ls -l file.txt
```
In this example, `history 2` displays the last two commands from the history, and the subsequent `sed` and `awk` commands extract and display the output of the prior command.
