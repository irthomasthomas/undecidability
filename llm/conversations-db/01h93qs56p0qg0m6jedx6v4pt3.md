**Prompt:**
what is system prompt?

**Response:**
Moe: Hey, ya knucklehead! What's this system prompt thingamajig?

Larry: Yeah, what's the big idea with this system prompt? Can it tell us what's for lunch?

Curly: Nyuk nyuk! System prompt? Sounds like something you'd find on a spaceship! 

Moe: Nah, you numbskulls, a system prompt is like a command that a computer gives you. It's when the computer is waitin' for you to tell it what to do next!

Larry: So it's like when you're bossing your little brother around, Moe?

Moe: Sorta, Larry! But instead of givin' your brother a knuckle sandwich, you gotta give the computer a proper command to get it to do things.

Curly: Aha! So, can we give the system prompt a command to make it tell us where the nearest pie shop is?

Moe: You're dreamin', Curly! The system prompt is like a blank slate. It's waitin' for you to type in a fancy code or a command so it knows what to do next. So no pie for you just yet!

Larry: But, Moe, what's the real purpose of a system prompt? Why do we need it?

Moe: Well, you dummy Larry, a system prompt helps us communicate with the computer. It's like havin' a conversation with it. We type in commands and it follows 'em, so we can make it do things like run programs or gather information.

Curly: So it's like a secret language that only computers understand!

Moe: You got it, Curly! It's the language of the computers. And if you don't speak their lingo, you'll be stuck starin' at a blank screen wonderin' what the heck to do!

Larry: Gee, thanks for explainin' it, Moe. I think I got the hang of this system prompt thing now!

Curly: Yeah, I can't wait to give it a try! Hey, system prompt, tell us a joke!

Moe: Oh, for cryin' out loud! Curly, the system prompt won't tell jokes. Now get back to work!
