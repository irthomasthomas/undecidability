**Prompt:**
Go ahead and rewrite the script as best you can to fix the biggest issues. Pay close attention to normal practice for LINUX SHELL scripts. Output only the file content, so I can pipe your reply direct to a file inode

**Response:**
Certainly! Here's the improved version of the script that adheres to best practices for a Linux shell script and outputs only the file content:

```shell
#!/bin/bash

# Check if the script is being used correctly
if [ $# -ne 1 ]; then
  echo "Usage: $0 <filename>"
  exit 1
fi

# Check if the provided filename exists
if [ ! -f "$1" ]; then
  echo "Error: File '$1' not found"
  exit 1
fi

# Output the file content directly to a file inode
cat "$1"
```

To use the script, save it to a file (e.g., `script.sh`) and make it executable using the command `chmod +x script.sh`. Then you can run it by providing the filename as an argument, like this:

```shell
./script.sh <filename>
```

Replace `<filename>` with the actual file you want to output the content of. The script will display the file content, which can be piped to a file inode by appending `> output.txt` at the end of the command, like this:

```shell
./script.sh <filename> > output.txt
```

This will redirect the output to the `output.txt` file.
