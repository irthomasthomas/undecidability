**Response:**
Feature Request: New Linux CLI Tool - 'SysTrack'

SysTrack is proposed as a new Linux CLI tool written in bash, intended to provide users with instantaneous system and network health updates. It should monitor system and network performance data, provide statistical analysis, and feature alerts for significant changes or potential issues.

Detailed Instructions:

1. Dashboard:
   The tool should have a CLI-based dashboard that shows system and network statistics. Information should be easily-readable and well-organized, detailing:
   - CPU Usage 
   - RAM Usage
   - Disk Usage
   - Network Activity (Data sent/received)
   - Active Processes
   - System Uptime

2. Automatic Notifications:
   Users should be notified when certain thresholds are crossed. For example, if CPU usage exceeds a certain percentage, the tool should alert users. Users should have the option to customize these thresholds.

3. Historical Data and Trends: 
   The tool should log data and allow users to view historical trends for network and system performance. Provide daily, weekly, and monthly views.

4. Portability:
   Ensure the tool could be run on various Linux distributions without the need for specific packages not commonly included in a minimal installation.

5. User-friendly:
   Keep commands and options simple and intuitive. Follow the structure and syntax of common Linux commands to maintain consistency and user-friendliness.

Automated Test:

1. Test data collection functionality: 
   - Create a logic that simulates high CPU usage, abundant disk activity, or excessive network usage. 
   - Run the tool and verify if it collects the data correctly and accurately represents the simulated conditions.

2. Test alert functionality: 
   - Set a low threshold for alerts.
   - Simulate conditions that exceed these thresholds.
   - Check if the alerts are triggered as designed.
   
3. Test data representation: 
   - For historical data and trends, simulate a weekâ€™s data.
   - Check to see if the tool properly logs and represents this data.
   
4. Portability test: 
   - Run the tool on various popular Linux distributions (Ubuntu, Debian, Fedora, etc.).
   - Confirm the tool works as expected across all these distributions.

5. Test User-friendliness:
   - Get users of different expertise levels (novice, intermediate, advanced) to test the tool. Check their feedback to ensure the tool is user-friendly and intuitive. If issues are found, adjust accordingly.
  
By following these guidelines, we should be able to create 'SysTrack' as a versatile and user-friendly Linux CLI tool. It will be appreciated by system administrators for its simplicity, effectiveness, and customizable nature.
