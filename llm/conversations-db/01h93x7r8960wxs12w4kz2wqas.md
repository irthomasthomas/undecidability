**Prompt:**
Think of a new idea for a small neat little linux cli tool written in bash. Write your feature request and detailed instructions to the programmer for him to build. Make sure to include all information required. And specify an automated test

**Response:**
Feature Request: A bash CLI tool named "Regress"

Objective: To track and revert the modifications made in the file structure of specified directories in a Linux environment. 

Detailed Instructions: 

1. The tool is invoked through the command `regress`.

2. It should have two primary operations: `track` and `revert`.
   - `track [directory path]` - Start taking snapshots of the directory structure and file changes over certain intervals (set to 1 hour by default). Save snapshots in a hidden ".regress" directory.
   - `revert [directory path] [timestamp]` - Revert all changes made to the files in the given directory path to the state at the specified timestamp. If `[timestamp]` is not provided, revert to the latest saved snapshot.

3. When running ‘track’, ensure snapshots are labeled  with date-time information in the format "YYYYMMDD-hhmm", saved in a ".snapshot" file in the specified folder.

4. The ‘revert’ operation should check if the specified folder is being tracked. If it isn't, throw an error "Directory not being tracked".

5. If the directory is being tracked, check the timestamp. If a snapshot doesn't exist for that timestamp, throw an error "Snapshot not found".

6. The 'revert' should apply all file deletions, creations, and modifications based on the snapshot data.

7. Optional Enhancement - Add a `status [directory path]` operation which displays the latest snapshot and the changes from that snapshot to the current state of files.

8. Create, read, and delete operations should handle permission errors gracefully by informing the user that operation could not be performed due to insufficient permissions.

Automated Test:

1. Create a testing directory with a few example files and directories within it.

2. Start tracking that directory using the 'track' operation.

3. Modify, add, and delete some files and folders within the testing directory.

4. Run the 'revert' operation without specifying a timestamp. Check if the files returned to the state of the latest snapshot.

5. Make some changes again and run 'revert' with the original timestamp. Check if the files returned to the original state.

6. Run the 'status' operation, if implemented, and check if the output is as expected.

7. Test the error cases: try tracking and reverting changes in a non-existing directory; try reverting to a non-existing timestamp; test insufficient permissions in creating, reading, and deleting files.

This tool can prove highly useful for developers who often need to revert their filesystem structure to a previous state. It will make their work more efficient and less error-prone.
