**Prompt:**
Think of a new idea for a neat little linux cli tool written in bash. Write your feature request and detailed instructions to the programmer for him to build. Make sure to include all information required. And specify an automated test

**Response:**
Feature Request: Linux CLI Tool - "SysScan"

Description:
"SysScan" is a neat little Linux command-line tool written in Bash that allows users to perform a comprehensive system scan, providing detailed information about the system's hardware and software specifications. The utility should gather essential data related to the system's CPU, memory, storage, network, operating system, and installed software packages, presenting it in a user-friendly manner.

Instructions:
1. Installation:
   a. The programmer should ensure that Bash is installed on the Linux system.
   b. Provide a shell script named "sysscan.sh" for easy installation.
   c. Include appropriate instructions in the script to set up any required dependencies.

2. Execution:
   a. Users should be able to run the tool by entering the command "sysscan" in the terminal.
   b. The tool should be designed to support both user invocation (interactive mode) and automated usage (non-interactive mode).

3. Interactive Mode:
   a. Upon execution, the tool should display a welcome message and menu options to the user.
   b. The user should be able to choose from the following menu options:
      - 1. View System Information
      - 2. Scan CPU
      - 3. Scan Memory
      - 4. Scan Storage
      - 5. Scan Network
      - 6. Scan Operating System
      - 7. Scan Installed Software Packages
      - 8. Exit
   c. When a user selects a specific option, the tool should provide the requested information and return to the main menu.

4. Non-Interactive Mode:
   a. Users should have the option to supply command-line arguments to retrieve specific system information directly without entering the interactive mode.
   b. The command-line arguments should be as follows:
      - "--cpu": Print CPU information
      - "--memory": Print memory information
      - "--storage": Print storage information
      - "--network": Print network information
      - "--os": Print operating system information
      - "--packages": Print installed software package information
      - "--help": Display usage instructions

Automated Test:
To ensure the accuracy and functionality of the "SysScan" tool, an automated test suite should be implemented. The test suite should cover various scenarios, including:
1. Running the tool in the interactive mode and checking if the information displayed matches the system specifications.
2. Running the tool in non-interactive mode with different command-line arguments, and verifying if the specific information is correctly displayed.
3. Handling edge cases such as systems with minimal or unusual configurations (e.g., low memory, no network connection, etc.) to ensure proper error handling.
4. Testing the "--help" argument and making sure that the usage instructions are clear and comprehensive.

By incorporating this feature request and implementing an automated test suite, the "SysScan" tool will allow Linux users to conveniently gather crucial system information and enhance system administration tasks.
