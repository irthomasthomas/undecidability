**Prompt:**
Think of a new idea for a SMALL, neat, self-contained little linux cli tool written in bash. Something which is sorely missing, currently. Write your feature request and specifications to the programmer for him to build. Make sure to include all information required. And specify an automated test.

**Response:**
Title: bashUni: A Universal Clipboard Manager for Linux

Feature Request:
I would like to propose the development of a small, self-contained Linux CLI tool called bashUni, which acts as a universal clipboard manager. In today's fast-paced digital world, having a simple yet effective way to manage clipboard history could greatly enhance productivity and convenience. bashUni should be written in Bash scripting language, ensuring its compatibility with a wide range of Linux systems.

Specifications:
1. Clipboard History Tracking: bashUni should keep track of a user's clipboard history, storing the text content of each copied item.

2. Intuitive CLI Interface:
   - Upon launching bashUni, it should display the current clipboard history (if any) with timestamp information.
   - To select an item from the clipboard history, the user can enter the corresponding index number.
   - An option to clear the clipboard history should be included.

3. Seamless Integration with Linux Environment:
   - bashUni should be able to capture clipboard history whenever text is copied to the primary or secondary system clipboard (Ctrl+C, Ctrl+Shift+C).
   - Support for both graphical (X11) and terminal-based (TTY) environments would be ideal.

Automated Test:
To ensure the reliability and functionality of bashUni, an automated test suite should be implemented. The test suite might include the following scenarios:
1. Simulate copying multiple text snippets to the clipboard, ensuring they appear correctly in the clipboard history.
2. Verify that the timestamp information associated with each clipboard item is accurate.
3. Test the selection and retrieval of clipboard items based on their index number.
4. Confirm the proper functioning of clearing the clipboard history.
5. Verify the compatibility of bashUni with a variety of Linux distributions, X11, and TTY environments.

I believe that bashUni would fill a gap in the Linux ecosystem, providing a lightweight and efficient solution for managing clipboard history from the command-line interface. Its simplicity, self-containment, and compatibility would make it an invaluable tool for Linux power users and sysadmins.
