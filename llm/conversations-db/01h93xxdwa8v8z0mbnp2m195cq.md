Title: bashUni: A Universal Clipboard Manager for Linux

Feature Request:
I would like to propose the development of a small, self-contained Linux CLI tool called bashUni, which acts as a universal clipboard manager. In today's fast-paced digital world, having a simple yet effective way to manage clipboard history could greatly enhance productivity and convenience. bashUni should be written in Bash scripting language, ensuring its compatibility with a wide range of Linux systems.

Specifications:
1. Clipboard History Tracking: bashUni should keep track of a user's clipboard history, storing the text content of each copied item.

2. Intuitive CLI Interface:
   - Upon launching bashUni, it should display the current clipboard history (if any) with timestamp information.
   - To select an item from the clipboard history, the user can enter the corresponding index number.
   - An option to clear the clipboard history should be included.

3. Seamless Integration with Linux Environment:
   - bashUni should be able to capture clipboard history whenever text is copied to the primary or secondary system clipboard (Ctrl+C, Ctrl+Shift+C).
   - Support for both graphical (X11) and terminal-based (TTY) environments would be ideal.

Automated Test:
To ensure the reliability and functionality of bashUni, an automated test suite should be implemented. The test suite might include the following scenarios:
1. Simulate copying multiple text snippets to the clipboard, ensuring they appear correctly in the clipboard history.
2. Verify that the timestamp information associated with each clipboard item is accurate.
3. Test the selection and retrieval of clipboard items based on their index number.
4. Confirm the proper functioning of clearing the clipboard history.
5. Verify the compatibility of bashUni with a variety of Linux distributions, X11, and TTY environments.

I believe that bashUni would fill a gap in the Linux ecosystem, providing a lightweight and efficient solution for managing clipboard history from the command-line interface. Its simplicity, self-containment, and compatibility would make it an invaluable tool for Linux power users and sysadmins.
 Write a bash script and tests for the following request

**Response:**
Sure, here is a simplified version of a Bash script satisfying the feature requests. Please note that this script relies on `xclip` which needs to be installed on the system. 

bashUni.sh:
```bash
#!/bin/bash

# Define an array to store clipboard history
clipboard_history=()

# Infinite loop to continuously monitor clipboard changes
while true; do
    # Get current contents of the clipboard
    current_clip_content=$(xclip -selection clipboard -o 2>/dev/null)

    # If clipboard contents not empty and not in history already
    if [[ ! -z $current_clip_content ]] && [[ ! "${clipboard_history[*]}" == *"$current_clip_content"* ]]; then
        # Append current clipboard contents with timestamp to clipboard history
        clipboard_history+=("$(date +"%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S") - $current_clip_content")
    fi

    # If history becomes too large, manage its size
    if [[ ${#clipboard_history[@]} -gt 1000 ]]; then
        clipboard_history=("${clipboard_history[@]:1}")
    fi

    # Delay before next clipboard check
    sleep 0.5
done
```

TestbashUni.sh:
```bash
#!/bin/bash
# Test case: copy a string to clipboard and check if added to history.
echo "HELLO" | xclip -selection clipboard
sleep 1
if [[ ! "${clipboard_history[*]}" == *"HELLO"* ]]; then
    echo "Test failed: entry not found in clipboard history."
    exit 1
fi

# Test case: clear the clipboard and check if history is cleared.
echo -n "" | xclip -selection clipboard
clipboard_history=()
if [[ ! -z "${clipboard_history[*]}" ]]; then
    echo "Test failed: clipboard history not cleared."
    exit 1
fi

# Test case: check timestamping
echo "timestampTest" | xclip -selection clipboard
sleep 1
current_timestamp=$(date +"%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S")
if [[ ! "${clipboard_history[*]}" == *"$current_timestamp"* ]]; then
    echo "Test failed: timestamp for clipboard entry not found."
    exit 1
fi
echo "All tests passed."
```

Please note that in the real environment, the solution would be more complex to cover issues like parallel executions, clipboard updates from different applications and would potentially require a more complex implementation. It would be definitely beneficial to consider existing solutions first, like ClipIt or Parcellite on GUI-based systems or Screen for terminal.
