**Prompt:**
zcat $(man -w xautomation) | pandoc -f man -t plain | strip-tags
 Here is a linux terminal command I run to get a text version of a man page. Now I want to send the output to a github issue for the repo I am in. It should use the name of the tool in the man -w command as the title of the issue, and the output as the body

**Response:**
To achieve this, you will need to use GitHub's API to post an issue.

You'll also have to convert the text to Markdown format, because GitHub uses Markdown for the formatting issues and comments.

Given that you've authenticated to the GitHub API (step not covered here), doing something like this would work:

```bash
tool="xautomation"
body=$(zcat $(man -w "$tool") | pandoc -f man -t markdown | strip-tags)

curl -H "Authorization: token <your_github_token>" \
     -d '{"title": "'"Issue: $tool"'", "body": "'"$body"'"}' \
     https://api.github.com/repos/<user>/<repo>/issues
```

Replace `<your_github_token>` with your GitHub API token, `<user>` with your GitHub username (or the repository owner's GitHub username if it's not your repository), and `<repo>` with the name of the repository. 

Please note this lacks error checking, token hiding, and other aspects of a well-written script or program. It's only a proof of concept.

Also ensure to remove the `strip-tags` part if it's not a function or command in your path. I didn't find any standard command-line utility with that name. The pandoc conversion to Markdown should already provide suitable output.

Don't forget to replace `xautomation` with the tool name you want to create a problem with. If you want the script to be general, consider passing the tool name as a parameter to it.

Keep in mind, You'll probably hit API rate limits pretty quickly if you do this a lot in a short span of time. Every authenticated user is allowed up to 5000 requests per hour.
