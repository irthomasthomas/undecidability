**Prompt:**
Think about this carefully. How do you make an L in ascii art? How do you write an M? Now, Write  "LLM" as ascii art

**Response:**
Certainly! Here's an example of "LLM" written in ASCII art:

```
LL        L         M           M
LL        L  L    M M       M M
LL        L  L   M   M    M   M
LL        L  L   M     M M     M
LL        L  L   M           M
LLLLL  LLLLLL   M           M
```

Please note that the specific style and design of ASCII art can vary, and this is just one possible representation of "LLM".
