NAME xautomation - control X from the command line, and find things on
the screen

DESCRIPTION xautomation is a set of command lines programs to control X
and do "visual scraping" to find things on the screen. The control
interface allows mouse movement, clicking, button up/down, key up/down,
etc, and uses the XTest extension so you don't have the annoying
problems that xse has when apps ignore sent events. The visgrep program
find images inside of images and reports the coordinates, allowing
programs to find buttons, etc, on the screen to click on.

xautomation consists in the following programs:

pat2ppm Converts an image file from PAT to PPM format.

patextract Extract a part of a PNG image file.

png2pat Converts an image file from PNG to PAT format.

rgb2pat Converts an image file from 24-bit RGB to PAT format

visgrep Visual grep, greps for images in another image.

xte Generates fake input using the XTest extension.

For more information, please see the individual manpages of these
programs.
