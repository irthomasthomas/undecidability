**Prompt:**
think about it carefully. What tools or scripts are available to get the list of man pagess that ore typically listed as: SEE ALSO man(1), apropos(1), groff(1), less(1)

**Response:**
The tools or scripts that could be used to get a list of man pages typically listed as "SEE ALSO" are:

1. `man -k` or `apropos`: The man -k command in Linux is used to search the short manual page descriptions for keywords and display any matches.

2. `groff -man`: Groff is a typesetting package which reads plain text mixed with formatting commands and produces formatted output.

3. `less`: It is a program similar to more (1), but which allows backward movement in the file as well as forward movement.

4. `whatis`: It displays the manual page descriptions for each of the specified names.

5. `man -f`: Similar to whatis, it displays the manual page name list provided.

6. `locate`: You can use locate command to find manual pages and "SEE ALSO" section from them but it requires updatedb(1) database.

Make sure that the directory in which the man pages are located is included in the MANPATH, or they will not be found.

Note: All of these commands are used in Terminal or Command Line Interface (CLI).
