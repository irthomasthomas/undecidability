**Prompt:**
think about it carefully. What tools or scripts are available to get the list of man pagess that ore typically listed as: SEE ALSO man(1), apropos(1), groff(1), less(1)

**Response:**
To get the list of man pages you can use several tools:

1. `man -k .`: This command in Linux terminal will show you all available man pages that are in your system. This command functions as an 'apropos' command. It searches the short descriptions and manual page names for the keyword.

2. Another command is `whatis -w *`: This will also list all the man pages in your system in a less detailed form.

3. `ls /usr/share/man/man1`: This command will list all manual related files of user commands (section 1) stored in the directory.

All these tool commands can be executed in your terminal. `Man`, `apropos`, and `less` are all terminal commands, while `groff` is a typesetting system that formats the manual pages.

Here are the scripts that do the same:

1. Bash script

```bash
#!/bin/bash
apropos . | cut -d\) -f1 | cut -d\( -f1
```

2. Python script

```python
import os
path = "/usr/share/man/man1"
files = os.listdir(path)
for file in files:
    print(file)
```

These scripts will return a list of man pages available in your system. However, please note they will display only names without descriptions.

**Prompt:**
No. I want to start from one man page and then walk over the list of SEE ALSO mans. apropos man returns hundreds

**Response:**
Apologies for misunderstanding the original requirement. 

In order to extract the "SEE ALSO" man pages from a specific man page and then continue to their own "SEE ALSO" references, you'll need to use a combination of text processing tools such as `grep`, `awk`, `sed` along with looped scripting structure.

Currently, to my knowledge, there's not an existing, ready-to-use script or tool which can do it directly. However, here is a starting point for such a shell script:

```bash
#!/bin/bash
function extract_man_pages() {
    man -Tascii $1 | awk '/SEE ALSO/,/*/' | grep -o '[a-zA-Z0-9_-]*([1-8])'
}

START_PAGE=$1
queue=("$START_PAGE")
visited=("$START_PAGE")

while (( ${#queue[@]} )); do
    current=${queue[0]}
    queue=("${queue[@]:1}")
    echo "Visiting $current"
    new_pages=( $(extract_man_pages $current) )
    for new_page in "${new_pages[@]}"; do
        if ! [[ " ${visited[@]} " =~ " ${new_page} " ]]; then
            queue+=("$new_page")
            visited+=("$new_page")
        fi
    done
done
```

In this script you replace `START_PAGE` with the man page you wish to start from. This script will check the SEE ALSO section of a man page, find referenced pages there, and then repeat the process for all newly found pages until no new ones are discovered. Please note, this script doesn't handle pages names that contains spaces well and can potentially result in looping if there are cycle in the "SEE ALSO" references.
  
It's important to note the `man -Tascii` command may not work in some environments. If this is the case in your environment, consider installing groff (GNU troff) which is a typesetting package that reads plain text mixed with formatting commands and produces formatted output.

**Prompt:**
Github Project that stores man pages in different formats. Original_plain, Original_MD, Summary_MD, Embedding. Think of all the ways to do this (storing different formats of a document) that is very simple and intuitive. It should use github, gh issues maybe? Where the issue body is the Original_plain, and each other version is a comment. Then use github actions to organise them? I'm just spitballing, but aim is to be able to search man pages from cli and be able to retrieve the different formats.

**Response:**
It sounds like you have the beginnings of a great project in mind. Here is a possible approach for designing a project with your requirements in mind:

1. Repository Structure: 
   - Create a Github Repository, say `manpages-formatted`. 
   - Each man page would exist as a separate folder named based on convention like `cmd-section` (e.g. `ls-1`).
   - In each directory, different format files would exist as `original.txt`, `original.md`, `summary.md`, `embeddings.txt` etc.

2. Using GitHub Issues:
    - Create a new issue for each man page. 
    - The body of issue could be the plain text man page. 
    - Each different format (like MD, Embedded, Summary) could be a unique comment on that issue.
    - Every issue could be labeled for easier searching.

3. GitHub Actions:
    - GitHub actions could be used to automate the process. 
    - When a new man page is added (as a new issue), the action would run a script that converts the issue body into different formats, add these as comments and also update the repo by creating new files.

4. Deploy a CLI tool:
    - You could develop a CLI tool for searching these man pages from GitHub.
    - The CLI would communicate with the GitHub API to perform searches based on user-inputted keywords.
    - The CLI can retrieve the formatted text from the comments of the respective issue, or directly from the files in the repository.

However, remember to take into account GitHub's rate limiting and/or potential costs for heavy usage. Storing such data and numerous requests would be subject to these limitations, so it would be important to build the system considering these factors.

Also there are many potential details depending on the exact requirements and constraints of your project. You should validate your requirements and constraints before beginning this project.
