"Request: " Create a new issue with title,body,tags


**Response:**
To create a new issue with a title, body, and tags using the github CLI tool, you can use the `gh issue create` command. Here's the syntax you can use:

```bash
gh issue create --title "Title of the issue" --body "Body of the issue" --label "tag1" --label "tag2"
```

Replace "Title of the issue" with the desired title for the issue and "Body of the issue" with the actual content of the issue. You can also specify one or more tags by using the `--label` option multiple times, as shown above.

Here's an example of how the command could look:

```bash
gh issue create --title "Bug in authentication process" --body "When I try to login, I encounter an error message." --label "bug" --label "authentication"
```

This command will create a new issue with the specified title, body, and tags.

Note: Make sure you have the Github CLI tool (`gh`) installed and authenticated with your Github account before running this command.
