"Request: " add a new label


**Response:**
To add a new label using `gh s`, you can't directly modify the labels of a repository from the search prompt. However, you can achieve this by combining `gh s` with other `gh` commands. Here's an example of how you can add a new label to a repository:

1. Search for the repository you want to add the label to:
```bash
gh s repository_name
```
Replace `repository_name` with the name of the repository you want to add the label to.

2. Fetch the repository URL using `xargs`:
```bash
gh s repository_name | xargs -n1 gh repo view
```

3. Copy the repository URL from the output and open it in your browser.

4. Once you have the repository open in your browser, navigate to the "Issues" tab.

5. Find the issue you want to add the label to and click on it.

6. On the issue page, you should see a "Labels" section. Click on "Edit" or "Add labels" to add a new label.

Note that this method assumes you have the necessary permissions to add labels to the repository. If you don't have the required permissions, you won't be able to add labels.

Remember to replace `repository_name` with the actual name of the repository you want to add the label to.
