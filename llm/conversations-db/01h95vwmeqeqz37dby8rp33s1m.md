**Prompt:**
I want to use github actions to automate this workflow: Look for new issues with an apropriate label. The body will be a url in plain text, and the title will be the subject of the url target. 1. Run Get_Plain_Text(url) > new issue comment > advance issue label to step 2 

**Response:**
To automate the described workflow using GitHub Actions, you can create a workflow file in your repository's `.github/workflows` directory. Let's name it `automate_workflow.yml`. Here's an example of how the workflow can be defined:

```yaml
name: Automated Workflow

on:
  issues:
    types:
      - labeled
  workflow_dispatch:

jobs:
  automate:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

    steps:
      - name: Check if issue has appropriate label
        id: check_label
        uses: actions/github-script@v5
        with:
          script: |
            const labels = ["appropriate-label"];
            const issueLabel = github.context.payload.issue.label.name;
            return {
              hasAppropriateLabel: labels.includes(issueLabel)
            }

      - name: Get Plain Text from URL
        id: get_plain_text
        if: ${{ steps.check_label.outputs.hasAppropriateLabel }}
        run: |
          # Use your method or tool to get plain text from the URL
          # and store it in a file named "plain_text.txt"

      - name: Create new issue comment with plain text URL
        id: create_comment
        if: ${{ steps.get_plain_text.outputs.return-code == 0 }}
        uses: actions/github-script@v5
        with:
          script: |
            const plainText = require('fs').readFileSync('plain_text.txt', 'utf8');
            github.issues.createComment({
              issue_number: github.context.payload.issue.number,
              owner: github.context.repo.owner,
              repo: github.context.repo.repo,
              body: plainText
            })

      - name: Advance issue label to Step 2
        if: ${{ steps.create_comment.outputs.return-code == 0 }}
        run: |
          # Use necessary API calls or tool to change issue label to "Step 2"
          # based on issue_number available in github.context.payload.issue.number
```

Make sure to replace `"appropriate-label"` with the actual label name that you want to trigger the workflow.

This workflow listens to the `labeled` event. Whenever an issue is labeled with the specified label, it goes through the following steps:

1. It checks if the issue has the appropriate label.
2. If the label is present, it runs the `Get Plain Text from URL` step, using your method or tool to obtain plain text from the URL.
3. If plain text is successfully retrieved, it creates a new comment on the issue using the plain text as the comment body.
4. Finally, it advances the issue label to "Step 2" using the necessary API calls or tool.

After creating the workflow file and pushing it to the repository, the workflow will automatically be triggered whenever an issue is labeled with the specified label. You can also manually trigger the workflow through the GitHub Actions interface if needed.
