**Prompt:**
 gh issue create --title xautomation --body "$( zcat $(man -w xautomation) | pandoc -f man -t plain )"  
 Think it through carefully, please, this is important and technical. Create a bash script based on the following command. It needs to record the output of the command in --body and also IMPORTANTLY it needs to record the command string also.

**Response:**
This bash script below captures both the command string and the command output.

```bash
#!/bin/bash

# Define command as a variable
cmd="zcat $(man -w xautomation) | pandoc -f man -t plain"

# Store command output in a variable
output=$(eval "$cmd")

# Store command string and output in a file
echo "Command: $cmd" > cmd_record.txt
echo "Output: $output" >> cmd_record.txt

# Create GitHub issue using gh cli
gh issue create --title xautomation --body "$(cat cmd_record.txt)"

# Cleanup the temporary file
rm cmd_record.txt
```

Please update the script name, paths, and permissions per your requirements. Save this script as `create_issue.sh` or any other name per your preference and give it executable permissions with `chmod +x create_issue.sh`. Run it with `./create_issue.sh`.

Also, be mindful that the gh cli should be correctly configured and authenticated with GitHub. The script assumes that you are running it in the correct repository context where you want to create the issue. You may want to error check if the `gh issue create` command was successful or not and handle it accordingly.

**Prompt:**
Thanks. Quick change request:\n cmd = $1 \n\n title= the man page title, in this case "xautomation" but NOT HARDCODED.\n\n calculate the token_count by passing output to a function called ttok that is defined outside of this. format the output as markdown, where the cmd is in an apropriately labeled code block, and the output is in another. I will need to be able to link directly to either the cmd block or the output block, so handle that.

**Response:**
You can adjust the bash script as follows:

```bash
#!/bin/bash

# The ttok function that calculates the token count
ttok () {
    echo -n $1 | wc -w
}

# Read the command from script argument
cmd=$1

# Extract the title from the man page command
title=$(echo $cmd | cut -d' ' -f2)

# Execute the command and store output in a variable
output=$(eval "$cmd")

# Calculate token_count
token_count=$(ttok "$output")

# Format command and output as markdown with appropriate code block
formatted_output="## Command\n\`\`\`\n$cmd\n\`\`\`\n\n## Output\n\`\`\`\n$output\n\`\`\`\n\n## Token Count\n$token_count"

# Save formatted_output to a file
echo "$formatted_output" > formatted_output.md

# Create GitHub issue using gh cli
gh issue create --title "$title" --body "$(cat formatted_output.md)"

# Cleanup the temporary file
rm formatted_output.md
```

This scripts requires '=' symbol for passing values to arguments like ./create_issue.sh cmd="man ls".

The markdown sections ## Command and ## Output can be linked directly in GitHub by using the links #user-content-command for Command and #user-content-output for Output. The markdown code syntax is used to encapsulate the command and its output.

The function `ttok` is defined in the script, but it can be defined outside the script and sourced when needed. Please adjust the script accordingly if needed.

Remember the command needs to be quoted when passed as an argument to this script, like so: `./create_issue.sh "ls -l"`.

**Prompt:**
Is that cut command reliable to extract title? What about parameter referencing instead?

**Response:**
Yes, you are correct. Using parameter referencing is a safer option and it is less prone to errors if the command changes in its structure. We can replace `cut` command with parameter expansion and string manipulation which is more reliable. Here is the updated script:

```bash
#!/bin/bash

# The ttok function that calculates the token count
ttok() {
    echo -n $1 | wc -w
}

# Read the command from script argument
cmd=$1

# Extract the title from the man page command
title=${1##* }

# Execute the command and store output in a variable
output=$(eval "$cmd")

# Calculate token count
token_count=$(ttok "$output")

# Format command and output as markdown with appropriate code block
formatted_output="## Command\n\`\`\`\n$cmd\n\`\`\`\n\n## Output\n\`\`\`\n$output\n\`\`\`\n\n## Token Count\n$token_count"

# Save formatted_output to a file
echo "$formatted_output" > formatted_output.md

# Create GitHub issue using gh cli
gh issue create --title "$title" --body "$(cat formatted_output.md)"

# Cleanup the temporary file
rm formatted_output.md
```

In this script `${1##* }` is used to extract "ls" when the argument is "man ls". This trims everything from the beginning of the string up to the last occurrence of a space. Please adjust the script accordingly if additional space-separated components are added to the command.

**Prompt:**
zcat $(man -w xautomation) | pandoc -f man -t plain
 remember, the command being passed in will be like: 

**Response:**
I apologize for the confusion earlier. The correct way to parse the command and extract the title in this specific case would be to split the input argument string by spaces, and use the last field as the "title". Here is how you can do it:

```bash
#!/bin/bash

# Function to count the tokens
ttok() {
    echo -n $1 | wc -w
}

# Read the command from script argument
cmd=$1

# Extract the title from the man page command
title=$(echo $cmd | awk '{print $NF}')

# Execute the command and store output in a variable
output=$(eval "$cmd")

# Calculate the token count
token_count=$(ttok "$output")

# Convert command and output into markdown format
formatted_output="## Command\n```bash\n$cmd\n```\n\n## Output\n```\n$output\n```\n\n## Token Count\n$token_count"

# Save the formatted_output to a file
echo -e "$formatted_output" > cmd_output.md

# Create a GitHub issue with gh cli
gh issue create --title "$title" --body-file "cmd_output.md"

# Remove the temporary file
rm cmd_output.md
```

This script takes a command as an argument in a manner like `./script.sh "zcat $(man -w xautomation) | pandoc -f man -t plain"`. It then executes the command, captures its output, formats it into a markdown file, and uses that as the body for a new GitHub issue. Remember, the input command needs to be quoted to be passed as a single argument to the script. 

IMPORTANT: Remember to make this script executable by running `chmod +x script.sh` where `script.sh` is the name you've chosen for it. Also, ensure the GitHub CLI is configured and authenticated before running this script, and it's executed from within the desired repository.
