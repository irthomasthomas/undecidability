**Prompt:**
Only use well known and documented cli flags. Never invent new flags or options for a tool. Only use valid bash or zsh options.
"Request: " view all labels


**Response:**
To view all labels on GitHub repositories, you can use the following command:

```
gh s -E -l "github"
```

This command will search for repositories with the language set to "github" and return the results. Since we're not specifying any other search criteria, it will show repositories with any topic or user.

You can pipe the output to other commands to further process the results. For example, to open the URLs of the repositories in your browser, you can use:

```
gh s -E -l "github" | xargs -n1 gh browse -R
```

This will open each repository URL in the default browser.

Note that the `gh` command-line tool is provided by GitHub CLI, so make sure you have it installed and configured before running these commands.
