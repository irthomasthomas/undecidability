**Prompt:**
I want to view the actual label list, not the issues under the labels

**Response:**
To view the actual label list in a specific repository on GitHub, follow these steps:

1. Open the repository on GitHub.
2. At the top of the repository's homepage, click on the "Issues" tab.
3. On the right-hand side, you will find the "Labels" section.
4. Click on the "Labels" button to open the label list.

This will show you the actual label list for that repository, without any issues associated with those labels.

**Prompt:**
in the gh cli?

**Response:**
Apologies for the confusion. To view the label list using GitHub CLI (gh), you can use the following command:

```
gh issue list --label
```

This command will display the labels and the number of open issues associated with each label. However, it does not provide a direct way to view only the label list without the associated issues.
