```
 When I send this markdown to a github issue, the function name is not apearing. Try to diagnose the formatting problems. Think carefully.

**Response:**
The function name is not appearing because it is not included in the formatted output of the function. This function is designed to take a command as an argument, execute it, and format the command and its output into a markdown format. The function name itself is not part of this process. 

If you want to include the function name in the markdown, you can modify the function to take an additional argument for the function name, or hardcode the function name into the formatted output. 

Here is an example of how you could modify the function to include the function name in the markdown:

```bash
cmd_and_output_to_markdown () {
	func_name="$1"
	cmd="$2" 
	title=$(echo $cmd | cut -d' ' -f2) 
	output=$(eval "$cmd") 
	token_count=$(ttok "$output") 
	formatted_output="## Function Name <a id='func_name'></a>
    \`\`\`
    ${func_name}
    \`\`\`
    [Link to Function Name](#func_name)

    ## Command <a id='command'></a>
    \`\`\`
    ${cmd}
    \`\`\`
    [Link to Command](#command)
    
    ## Token Count <a id='token_count'></a>
    \`\`\`
    ${token_count}
    \`\`\`
    [Link to Token Count](#token_count)
    
    ## Output <a id='output'></a>
    \`\`\`
    ${output}
    \`\`\`
    [Link to Output](#output)
    " 
	echo -e "$formatted_output"
}
```

You would then call this function with two arguments, the function name and the command, like so:

```bash
cmd_and_output_to_markdown "my_function_name" "ls -la"
```

**Prompt:**
No, the problem I have is this, '''bash\cmd_and_output_to_markdown () {, is being treated as one line. the \n is not respected. How do I fix that?

**Response:**
You can fix this problem by using a "Here Document" (or heredoc) in bash. A heredoc allows you to create a string that spans multiple lines and preserves line breaks.

Make sure to remove the leading spaces before each line or they will be included in the final string:

```bash
cmd_and_output_to_markdown () {
    cmd="$1" 
    title=$(echo $cmd | cut -d' ' -f2) 
    output=$(eval "$cmd") 
    token_count=$(ttok "$output") 
    formatted_output=$(cat << EOF
## Command <a id='command'></a>
```
${cmd}
```
[Link to Command](#command)

## Token Count <a id='token_count'></a>
```
${token_count}
```
[Link to Token Count](#token_count)

## Output <a id='output'></a>
```
${output}
```
[Link to Output](#output)
EOF
)
    echo "$formatted_output"
}
```

Then you would call it exactly as before:

```bash
cmd_and_output_to_markdown "ls -la"
```

This will print your formatted markdown with the appropriate newlines preserved. The string within the `<< EOF ... EOF` block is treated as is, without variable substitution, which is what is causing your newline issues. With this method, you can freely use newlines and they will be preserved in the final string.
