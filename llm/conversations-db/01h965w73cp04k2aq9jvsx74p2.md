**Prompt:**
What is a heredoc in bash?

**Response:**
In Bash, a heredoc (short for "here document") is a type of redirection that allows you to pass a large block of text as input to a command. It's often used in shell scripts to embed multi-line data. A heredoc begins with << followed by a unique identifier, and ends with the same identifier alone on its own line. Everything between these two lines is treated as the input or content of the heredoc.

Here's an example:

```
cat << EOF
Hello, 
This is a multi-line text
EOF
```

In this example, cat will accept the multi-line string contained within the EOF markers as input.

**Prompt:**
EOF?

**Response:**
EOF stands for "End Of File". In the context of a heredoc in Bash, EOF is a commonly used identifier to signal the start and end of the text block. However, you could use any word or sequence of characters as the identifier, not just "EOF". The important thing is that the identifier at the start and end of the heredoc are the same. For example:

```
cat << MYTEXT
Hello, 
This is a multi-line text
MYTEXT
```

"In this example, "MYTEXT" is used as the identifier instead of "EOF". Again, the text block starts immediately after the "<< MYTEXT" and ends when "MYTEXT" is found on a line by itself.
