How do you us \n newline and other formatting when sending a comment to github issues from gh cli

**Response:**
To use newline and other formatting options when sending a comment to GitHub Issues using the `gh` command-line interface (CLI), you can make use of Markdown syntax. Here's how you can achieve it:

1. Open your terminal or command prompt.
2. Log in to your GitHub account using the `gh auth login` command if you haven't already done so.
3. Navigate to your repository's directory using the `cd` command.
4. Create a new issue comment using the `gh issue comment create` command, followed by the issue number and the `-b` flag to open your default text editor:
```shell
gh issue comment create <issue-number> -b
```
5. Inside the text editor, use Markdown syntax to format your comment. For example, for a newline, use `\n`. However, keep in mind that some platforms or tools may not interpret this correctly. Alternatively, you can use two spaces at the end of a line to create a new line.
6. Save and close the text editor.
7. The comment will be submitted to GitHub Issues with the desired formatting.

Here's an example of creating a comment with a newline using `gh` CLI:

```shell
gh issue comment create 123 -b
```

In the text editor:
```
Hello world!\n
This is a new line.
```

After saving and closing the text editor, your comment will be submitted with the newline:

```
Hello world!
This is a new line.
```

Remember to adapt the above steps to your specific issue and repository details.

**Prompt:**
It needs to be automated

**Response:**
To automate the process of sending a comment with formatting to GitHub Issues using `gh` CLI, you can make use of shell scripting. Here's an example script that creates a comment with a newline:

```bash
#!/bin/bash

issue_number="<issue-number>"
comment_text="Hello world!%0aThis is a new line."

gh issue comment create $issue_number --body "$comment_text"
```

In the script above:
- Replace `<issue-number>` with the actual issue number.
- Modify the `comment_text` variable to include your desired comment text with formatting. Use `%0a` to represent a newline.

Save the script in a file, e.g., `comment.sh`. 

Make the file executable by running the following command in your terminal:
```shell
chmod +x comment.sh
```

Now, when you run `./comment.sh` in your terminal, it will automatically create the comment with formatting.

You can further customize the script to suit your specific requirements by adding more comment text, additional formatting, or even variables to make it more dynamic.

**Prompt:**
how can I send it in one command from linux terminal?

**Response:**
To send a comment with formatting in a single command from the Linux terminal using `gh` CLI, you can make use of command substitution and inline line breaks. Here's an example:

```bash
gh issue comment create <issue-number> -b "Hello world!\\nThis is a new line."
```

In the command above, replace `<issue-number>` with the actual issue number. The comment text is enclosed in double quotes (`"`). To represent a newline, use `\\n`.

For example, to create a comment with the issue number 123 and the comment text "Hello world!" on one line and "This is a new line." on another line, you can use the following command:

```bash
gh issue comment create 123 -b "Hello world!\\nThis is a new line."
```

When you execute the command in the terminal, it will create the comment with the desired formatting.

Note: The specific formatting options available may vary depending on the platform or tools used to view the comments. Make sure to verify the behavior on GitHub to ensure the desired formatting is achieved.
