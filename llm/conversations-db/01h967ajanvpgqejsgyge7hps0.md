**Prompt:**
Please think it through carefull, how do I include newlines in text I am sending from the linux terminal to github markdown issue

**Response:**
In GitHub markdown, to include new lines or line breaks you can do the following:

1. Use two spaces at the end of the line: Spaces on the end of a line in code are typically ignored, but Markdown uses two spaces at the end of a line to mean a line break.

   In terminal it would look like:

    ```bash
    echo "Line 1  \nLine 2" > my_file.md
    ```

2. Use two new lines to make separate paragraphs:

   In terminal it would look like:

    ```bash
    echo "Line 1\n\nLine 2" > my_file.md
    ```
3. Use '<br />' tag to enforce a line break:

   In terminal it would look like:

    ```bash
    echo -e "Line 1<br />\nLine 2" > my_file.md
    ```
4. Use the '\n' escape character that represents a newline character:

   In terminal it would look like:

    ```bash
    echo -e "Line 1\nLine 2" > my_file.md
    ```

Note: The "-e" option in echo command is used to interpret backslash escapes.

But be aware that `-e` isn't universally supported in every version of echo, check your shell's echo command documentation if itâ€™s not working.

Also, do not forget to replace `my_file.md` with the actual path to your markdown file.

When you're ready to publish the issue, you will be able to view the markdown in the preview to ensure it's formatted as expected.
