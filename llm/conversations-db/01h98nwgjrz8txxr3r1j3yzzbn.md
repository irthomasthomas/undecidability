**Prompt:**
Hey Dylan congrats on the results. When are you off to Uni?

Did you speak to Iss about the AI gifts I suggested? I want to give you both some AI tools subscriptions. Maybe Iss isn't very interested, but it will accelerate your compsci studies massively. You should see the stuff I'm doing with it. T'other week I used it to help me fix an important open-source tool.  Stream-deck-linux, it's an USB device/ a grid of buttons made of mini LCD screens for running custom actions. It's used mostly by streamers. Officially, they don't support Linux, so Linux streamers rely on the open-source, volunteer project to keep it running. So, the other week a software update on Linux desktop broke the thing. An update to a library introduced breaking changes. ( The infuriating act of making changes to a library/API software that will cause the apps that use it to break, unless rewritten to accommodate the change. ) Anyway, long story short, the original developer and owner/maintainer of the GitHub repo has disappeared. Well, I don't stream, but I've written so many macros that control my desktop and automate my workflow, that I can barely use my PC without it. So I went to work on a fix, and other people started organising a migration to a new repo, otherwise we couldnt push the fix out to the normal users. 

Getting to the ai GPT-4 point.. initially I went about fixing it the wrong way. I looked at my error message to see what broke code it complained of, then I went to the changelog of the library that documents the changes you have to make to keep using it. I fixed that line, my stream-deck worked and I pushed my change to GitHub. But problem, someone reports continued crashing and another broken library error. So I looked at it, and found another thing needed updating. That was an easy fix, but I realised I'd been an idiot. I'd been laser focused on solving the individual errors as they popped up. That's the Hunter Gather personality type, we're laser focused on whatever happens to be infront of us, and we follow it deep into the jungle. In the digital age it means I'm good at gathering data and sources and hunting down answers, but planning, prioritising and organising are beyond me. ( Still, Gladston said he could manage the affairs of a nation, but his own kitchen was a mystery to him. ) So, instead of looking at the error message in front of me, what I actually needed to do was study the change log, and search our code for all instances of the deprecated   library code. Then I had an idea or a question for chatgpt, and I suddenly remembered chatgpt existed. I'd been so engrossed that I'd basically forgotten that chantgpt existed. As soon as i remembered I kicked myself for wasting hours. Because this is literary THE perfect job for an AI language model, reading instructions from one document to update another. Because you aren't asking the AI to actually generate anything new exactly, it doesn't hallucinate as much and it's a lot more reliable. So I gave chatgpt the relevant code sections and the documentation for the library changes and asking it propose changes to fix it. And it suggested the exact two changes that I already made! So it confirmed I'd fixed everything, and saved me another hour, but if I'd used it from the start it would have saved me a lot more. Now, with the tools that we have, it is possible to fully automate that process. The software could have fixed itself. We just need to connect all the pipes together, the hard work is done. The only thing I needed to do manually was decide which files where relevant to send to the AI. I couldn't send everything because they can only read a limited amount of text, about 8000 tokens (~6000 words) at the time. Now I have access to models that can take 100,000 tokens. That means, next time, I won't even need to decide what docs to send, I can send the whole lot and let the model figure out..

**Response:**
Subject: Congratulations and the Gift of AI Tools

Hey Nephes,

I trust this email finds you buzzing with excitement on your imminent university journey. Your impressive results are a testament to your hard work and dedication - truly, congratulations! 

I've recently been speaking with Iss about a gift idea I had for you both. I've been exploring the world of AI tools and their myriad of applications, and I think these could be beneficial for your upcoming Computer Science studies. I understand the subject matter may not be Iss's cup of tea, but I believe these AI tool subscriptions could provide a significant boost to your academic journey.

I've been leveraging these tools in my work, with success. For instance, I recently modified an open-source tool called Stream-deck-linux. This tool comprises a grid of mini LCD screens that act as customizable buttons, primarily used by streamers. Its natural interested audience are those on Linux, so it became vital to restore functionality when a software update inadvertently broke the program due to changes in a crucial library. The tool's primary developer was missing, so I took it upon myself to fix it.

This whole process highlighted how AI tools can streamline workflows. Initially, my approach was to identify and resolve individual errors as they arose. After some struggle, it hit me that my path had been inefficient - AI could have completed the same task in no time!

I turned to GPT-4, a generative pre-trained transformer. Its power lies in its vast language model that can cross-reference instructions from one document to another with breath-taking accuracy. It was my pivotal, 'eureka!' moment. In this case, it confirmed my solutions and more importantly, demonstrated how it could have tackled the whole issue from the onset. In essence, it could have saved me hours. Reflecting on it, if utilized strategically, AI tools like this could virtually automate such processes.

On the downside, my limitation was having to decide which files to send to the AI, given its limited capacity to read a certain amount of text at a time. However, with access to models that can handle 100,000 tokens, next time, AI could even be entrusted with selecting the relevant documents for efficient resolution.

Consider this: youâ€™re on the precipice of your academic journey, equipped with AI tools that make learning fun and even simpler. Now, that's a head-start! I am sending these subscriptions your way. Embrace them, leverage them, and soar.

Best of luck!

Sincerely,
[Your Name]
