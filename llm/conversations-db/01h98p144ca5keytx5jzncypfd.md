**Prompt:**
Hey Dylan congrats on the results. When are you off to Uni?

Did you speak to Iss about the AI gifts I suggested? I want to give you both some AI tools subscriptions. Maybe Iss isn't very interested, but it will accelerate your compsci studies massively. You should see the stuff I'm doing with it. T'other week I used it to help me fix an important open-source tool.  Stream-deck-linux, it's an USB device/ a grid of buttons made of mini LCD screens for running custom actions. It's used mostly by streamers. Officially, they don't support Linux, so Linux streamers rely on the open-source, volunteer project to keep it running. So, the other week a software update on Linux desktop broke the thing. An update to a library introduced breaking changes. ( The infuriating act of making changes to a library/API software that will cause the apps that use it to break, unless rewritten to accommodate the change. ) Anyway, long story short, the original developer and owner/maintainer of the GitHub repo has disappeared. Well, I don't stream, but I've written so many macros that control my desktop and automate my workflow, that I can barely use my PC without it. So I went to work on a fix, and other people started organising a migration to a new repo, otherwise we couldnt push the fix out to the normal users. 

Getting to the ai GPT-4 point.. initially I went about fixing it the wrong way. I looked at my error message to see what broke code it complained of, then I went to the changelog of the library that documents the changes you have to make to keep using it. I fixed that line, my stream-deck worked and I pushed my change to GitHub. But problem, someone reports continued crashing and another broken library error. So I looked at it, and found another thing needed updating. That was an easy fix, but I realised I'd been an idiot. I'd been laser focused on solving the individual errors as they popped up. That's the Hunter Gather personality type, we're laser focused on whatever happens to be infront of us, and we follow it deep into the jungle. In the digital age it means I'm good at gathering data and sources and hunting down answers, but planning, prioritising and organising are beyond me. ( Still, Gladston said he could manage the affairs of a nation, but his own kitchen was a mystery to him. ) So, instead of looking at the error message in front of me, what I actually needed to do was study the change log, and search our code for all instances of the deprecated   library code. Then I had an idea or a question for chatgpt, and I suddenly remembered chatgpt existed. I'd been so engrossed that I'd basically forgotten that chantgpt existed. As soon as i remembered I kicked myself for wasting hours. Because this is literary THE perfect job for an AI language model, reading instructions from one document to update another. Because you aren't asking the AI to actually generate anything new exactly, it doesn't hallucinate as much and it's a lot more reliable. So I gave chatgpt the relevant code sections and the documentation for the library changes and asking it propose changes to fix it. And it suggested the exact two changes that I already made! So it confirmed I'd fixed everything, and saved me another hour, but if I'd used it from the start it would have saved me a lot more. Now, with the tools that we have, it is possible to fully automate that process. The software could have fixed itself. We just need to connect all the pipes together, the hard work is done. The only thing I needed to do manually was decide which files where relevant to send to the AI. I couldn't send everything because they can only read a limited amount of text, about 8000 tokens (~6000 words) at the time. Now I have access to models that can take 100,000 tokens. That means, next time, I won't even need to decide what docs to send, I can send the whole lot and let the model figure out..

 ok but prefer terse, functional sentances and leave more room for info. I think in terms of signal and noise. Flowery language only adds noise and diminishes the signal. Try again

**Response:**
Hey Dylan, congrats on the results! When are you starting university? Did you talk to Iss about the AI gifts I suggested? I think it could really accelerate your computer science studies. I've been using AI tools myself and they've been incredibly helpful. For example, I recently used it to fix an open-source tool called Stream-deck-linux, which had been broken by a library update. I realized that I had been focusing too much on individual errors instead of looking at the bigger picture. That's when I remembered about chatgpt, an AI language model that could help me with this task. I gave it the relevant code sections and documentation, and it suggested the exact changes I had already made. It saved me a lot of time and confirmed that I had fixed everything. With the tools we have now, it's possible to fully automate this process and let the software fix itself. I just had to manually decide which files to send to the AI. The next time, I won't even need to do that because I have access to models that can handle larger amounts of text. So, in summary, AI tools can be a game-changer for tasks like these. Let me know if you're interested in trying them out!
