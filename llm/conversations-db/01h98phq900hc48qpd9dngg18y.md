Hey Dylan congrats on the results. When are you off to Uni?

Did you speak to Iss about the AI gifts I suggested? I want to give you both some AI tools subscriptions. Maybe Iss isn't very interested, but it will accelerate your compsci studies massively. You should see the stuff I'm doing with it. T'other week I used it to help me fix an important open-source tool.  Stream-deck-linux, it's an USB device/ a grid of buttons made of mini LCD screens for running custom actions. It's used mostly by streamers. Officially, they don't support Linux, so Linux streamers rely on the open-source, volunteer project to keep it running. So, the other week a software update on Linux desktop broke the thing. An update to a library introduced breaking changes. ( The infuriating act of making changes to a library/API software that will cause the apps that use it to break, unless rewritten to accommodate the change. ) Anyway, long story short, the original developer and owner/maintainer of the GitHub repo has disappeared. Well, I don't stream, but I've written so many macros that control my desktop and automate my workflow, that I can barely use my PC without it. So I went to work on a fix, and other people started organising a migration to a new repo, otherwise we couldnt push the fix out to the normal users. 

Getting to the ai GPT-4 point.. initially I went about fixing it the wrong way. I looked at my error message to see what broke code it complained of, then I went to the changelog of the library that documents the changes you have to make to keep using it. I fixed that line, my stream-deck worked and I pushed my change to GitHub. But problem, someone reports continued crashing and another broken library error. So I looked at it, and found another thing needed updating. That was an easy fix, but I realised I'd been an idiot. I'd been laser focused on solving the individual errors as they popped up. That's the Hunter Gather personality type, we're laser focused on whatever happens to be infront of us, and we follow it deep into the jungle. In the digital age it means I'm good at gathering data and sources and hunting down answers, but planning, prioritising and organising are beyond me. ( Still, Gladston said he could manage the affairs of a nation, but his own kitchen was a mystery to him. ) So, instead of looking at the error message in front of me, what I actually needed to do was study the change log, and search our code for all instances of the deprecated   library code. Then I had an idea or a question for chatgpt, and I suddenly remembered chatgpt existed. I'd been so engrossed that I'd basically forgotten that chantgpt existed. As soon as i remembered I kicked myself for wasting hours. Because this is literary THE perfect job for an AI language model, reading instructions from one document to update another. Because you aren't asking the AI to actually generate anything new exactly, it doesn't hallucinate as much and it's a lot more reliable. So I gave chatgpt the relevant code sections and the documentation for the library changes and asking it propose changes to fix it. And it suggested the exact two changes that I already made! So it confirmed I'd fixed everything, and saved me another hour, but if I'd used it from the start it would have saved me a lot more. Now, with the tools that we have, it is possible to fully automate that process. The software could have fixed itself. We just need to connect all the pipes together, the hard work is done. The only thing I needed to do manually was decide which files where relevant to send to the AI. I couldn't send everything because they can only read a limited amount of text, about 8000 tokens (~6000 words) at the time. Now I have access to models that can take 100,000 tokens. That means, next time, I won't even need to decide what docs to send, I can send the whole lot and let the model figure out..

Hey Dylan, congrats on your results! When do you start Uni?

Did you talk to Iss about the AI gifts I mentioned? I want to give you both subscriptions for AI tools. It can really boost your compsci studies. I've been using it to do some amazing stuff lately. Just last week, I used it to fix a crucial open-source tool called Stream-deck-linux. It's a grid of mini LCD screens that function as buttons for custom actions, mainly used by streamers. The official support for Linux is lacking, so the open-source project is crucial for Linux streamers. However, a recent software update on Linux broke the tool due to changes in a library. Unfortunately, the original developer disappeared. Although I don't stream myself, I heavily rely on macros to control my desktop and automate my workflow. So, I decided to fix it and joined others in migrating to a new repository.

Now, here's where the AI comes in. Initially, I went about fixing it the wrong way. I focused on solving individual errors that popped up, rather than studying the change log and searching for instances of the deprecated library code throughout our codebase. I got so engrossed in the process that I completely forgot about chatgpt, an AI language model that would be perfect for this task. I finally remembered it and asked it to propose changes based on the code sections and library documentation I provided. Surprise! It suggested the exact two changes I had already made. If only I had used it from the start, it would have saved me so much time. With the tools we have now, we can fully automate this process. The software could have fixed itself. The only manual work I needed to do was selecting which files to send to the AI. Luckily, I have access to models that can process much more text, so next time I won't even need to decide what to send. I can just let the model figure it out.

So, what do you think about these AI tools? They can really accelerate your computer science studies. Let me know when you're heading to Uni, and I'll set it all up for you and Iss.

Its good, but for a couple of refinements: Assume reader knows what chatgpt is. And maybe just include a few more of the original points. But I like your version so keep that mostly the same other than the tweak and adding a few more points.

Thats' good but first two sentences are klunky. Also, importantly, official linux support for Stream Deck is not 'lacking', it is non existent.

I hate the first two sentences of paragraph one, about the AI gifts/AI tools, it sounds unnatural. The final sentence also sounds unnatural for an email.

**Response:**
Hey Dylan! Congrats on your results! Quick question, have you talked to Iss about the AI tools I mentioned? I think they'll be a game-changer for your compsci studies. I've been using them, and they've helped me do some amazing things. Just last week, I used AI to fix Stream-deck-linux, an important open-source tool used by streamers. The official support for Linux is non-existent, so the open-source project is essential. However, a recent software update caused some issues. The original developer disappeared, so it was up to us to find a solution.

Initially, I tackled the fix the wrong way, focusing on individual errors as they came up. But I soon realized the importance of studying the change log and searching our code for deprecated code. That's when I remembered chatgpt, the AI language model that could have really helped me from the start. I fed it the relevant code sections and library documentation, and it suggested the exact changes I had already made. If only I had used it earlier, it would have saved me so much time. With the tools we have now, we can fully automate this process. The only manual work is selecting which files to send to the AI, but even that will become easier with the enhanced models I have now.

By the way, let me know when you're heading to Uni, and I'll help set everything up for you and Iss. These AI tools will give you a major boost in your computer science studies!

Hey Dylan, congrats on your results! When do you start Uni?

Did you get a chance to talk to Iss about the AI gifts I mentioned? I think both of you would benefit greatly from AI tools that can really boost your compsci studies. I've been using them to accomplish some amazing things lately. For instance, just last week I used AI to fix Stream-deck-linux, an essential open-source tool used by streamers. It's a grid of mini LCD screens that serve as buttons for custom actions. Since the official support for Linux is nonexistent, the open-source project plays a vital role for Linux streamers. Unfortunately, a recent software update on Linux caused it to break due to changes in a library. To tackle the problem, I took the initiative and joined others in migrating to a new repository.

Now, here's where the AI comes in. Initially, I went about fixing it in the wrong way. Instead of studying the change log and searching for instances of the deprecated library code throughout our codebase, I focused on solving individual errors as they appeared. It wasn't until later that I remembered chatgpt, an AI language model that could have saved me a lot of time from the beginning. So, I provided chatgpt with the relevant code sections and library documentation, and it actually suggested the exact two changes I had already made. It confirmed that I had fixed everything correctly and saved me another hour. If only I had used it from the start, it would have been even more efficient. Now, with the tools we have, it's possible to fully automate this process. We just need to connect all the necessary components together, as the hard work is already done. The only manual task remaining is selecting which files to send to the AI, but with access to models that can process a substantial amount of text, it'll be much easier next time.

So, what do you think about these AI tools? They could significantly speed up your computer science studies. Let me know when you're heading to Uni, and I'll be more than happy to assist you and Iss in setting everything up.

Best wishes,
