**Prompt:**
Propose a title for the following issue:\n\nIf I were requesting this to a software development team or a developer, I would say:

"In the context of designing our shell scripts, I propose we aim to use logical operators for conditional checks, particularly in situations where the logic is straightforward. Specifically, I like the concise and compact nature of short-circuit evaluation involving && and || operators.

For instance, consider replacing traditional if-then-else constructs with their equivalent logical operator expressions where it's appropriate. A good example can be shown when comparing two variables, we could use [ "$a" = "$b" ] && echo "$b" || echo "$a" as an alternative to a multi-line if-then-else construct.

Please keep in mind, the proposed style can improve conciseness but may reduce readability for complex conditions. In such cases, adhering to the traditional if-then-else-fi structure may be more suitable. Thus, use your best judgement based on the situation and prioritize code clarity and maintainability."

This communicates the request clearly while also considering potential downsides and leaving room for the development team's discretion based on the specifics of the situation.
