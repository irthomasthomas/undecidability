**Prompt:**
in bash, return input formatted as a bash markdown block, using something like this maybe?  echo -e ```bash \n  ```

**Response:**
To format the input as a Bash markdown block using the `echo` command, you can use the following syntax:

```bash
echo -e "\`\`\`bash\n$(cat)\n\`\`\`"
```

Here's how it works:

1. The `echo` command is used to print the string.
2. The `-e` option enables the interpretation of escape sequences, such as `\n` for a new line.
3. The string is enclosed within double quotes `" "` to preserve spaces and new lines.
4. The `$(cat)` expression is used to capture the input from the user.
5. The `$(cat)` output is then placed between the opening and closing bash markdown block delimiters: `\`\`\`bash` and `\`\`\``.

For example, if you run this command and enter some Bash code as input, it will return the input formatted as a Bash markdown block.
