**Prompt:**
in bash, return input formatted as a bash markdown block, using something like this maybe?  echo -e ```bash \n  ```

**Response:**
To take an input from the user or another source and format it as a Bash markdown block, you can do something like:

```bash
#!/bin/bash
read -p "Enter your bash command: " input
echo -e "```bash\n${input}\n```"
```

This reads the input from the user, then outputs it enclosed in a markdown block.

You can run this script, then input a command when it prompts. The script then wraps your input in the markdown formatting for a Bash code block.

Example:

When you run this script it asks:

```
Enter your bash command:
```

You enter:

```
echo "Hello, World!"
```

And it returns:

```
```bash
echo "Hello, World!"
```
``` 

This is markdown syntax for a block formatted to indicate it's bash code. Depending on the viewer being used, this would appropriately color and format the enclosed code to indicate it is bash.
