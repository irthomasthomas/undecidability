**Response:**
Some key areas covered by the Treaty of Versailles include:

1) Territorial adjustments: The treaty redrew the map of Europe, primarily to dismantle the empires of defeated powers. Germany lost territory to France, Belgium, Denmark, and Poland, while Austria-Hungary was divided into several new countries.

2) Reparations: Germany was held primarily responsible for the war and was required to pay substantial reparations to the Allied powers. The exact sum was not specified in the treaty but was determined by a separate commission in 1921.

3) Military restrictions: Germany was greatly limited in terms of its military capabilities. It was not allowed to have an air force, submarines, or heavy artillery, and its army was limited to 100,000 men. The Rhineland was demilitarized, and the German navy was significantly reduced.

4) War guilt: The treaty included a clause (Article 231) stating that Germany accepted full responsibility for causing the war. This led to a sense of humiliation and resentment among the German population.

5) Creation of the League of Nations: The treaty established the League of Nations, an organization designed to promote international cooperation and prevent future conflicts. However, the United States, whose president, Woodrow Wilson, had been a key proponent of the League, did not ratify the treaty and did not join the organization.

6) Disarmament of other Central Powers: The treaty imposed military limitations on other defeated Central Powers, such as Austria, Hungary, Bulgaria, and Turkey. These countries were also required to make territorial concessions.

These are just some of the key areas covered by the Treaty of Versailles, and there were many other smaller provisions and clauses that dealt with issues such as war crimes, labor rights, and the treatment of prisoners of war.
