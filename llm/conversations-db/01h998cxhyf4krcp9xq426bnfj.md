**Response:**
The term "poker face" is often used to describe a facial expression that does not reveal one's thoughts or emotions, particularly in a poker game. It refers to maintaining a blank or neutral facial expression, not showing any reactions or emotions, as a way to hide any information about one's hand or intentions. The goal is to not give any clues to other players about the strength or weakness of one's cards, therefore increasing one's chances of winning. Having a good poker face can help players bluff or deceive their opponents, creating uncertainty and making it difficult for others to read their intentions.
