**Response:**
EMF stands for "electromagnetic field." It refers to the area of influence around an electric current or a magnetic field. Electromagnetic fields can be found in natural sources such as the Earth's magnetic field, as well as in man-made sources like power lines, Wi-Fi networks, and electrical appliances. EMF is measured in units of volts per meter (V/m) for electric fields and teslas (T) for magnetic fields. The potential health effects of exposure to high levels of EMF are still a topic of ongoing scientific research and debate.
