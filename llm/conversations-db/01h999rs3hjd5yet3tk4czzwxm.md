**Response:**
To calculate the actual percentage increase, you need to subtract the original value from the new value and then divide by the original value. In this case, the original value is $90,000 and the new value is $100,000.

The percentage increase can be calculated as follows:

($100,000 - $90,000) / $90,000 = $10,000 / $90,000 ≈ 0.1111 ≈ 11.11%

So, the actual percentage increase in this case is approximately 11.11%.
