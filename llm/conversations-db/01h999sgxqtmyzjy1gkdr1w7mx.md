**Prompt:**


**Response:**
There are several differences between a traditional book and an e-book:

1. Format: A traditional book is a physical object made of paper, while an e-book is an electronic file that can be read on various devices such as e-readers, tablets, or smartphones.

2. Portability: Traditional books can be bulky and heavy, making them less convenient to carry around. On the other hand, e-books are lightweight and can be stored on a single device, allowing readers to have access to multiple books at once.

3. Cost: Traditional books are generally more expensive than e-books. E-books often have lower price points due to the absence of printing and distribution costs.

4. Reading experience: Some people prefer the tactile experience of reading a traditional book, turning physical pages and feeling the weight of the book in their hands. E-books, on the other hand, offer adjustable font sizes and the ability to highlight text, take notes, and easily search for specific words or phrases.

5. Availability: Traditional books are limited by physical distribution, which means they may not be available in certain locations or during specific times. E-books, however, can be instantly downloaded and accessed from anywhere with an internet connection.

6. Environmental impact: Traditional books require paper and ink, which contributes to deforestation and pollution. E-books, being digital files, have a lower environmental impact in terms of resource consumption and waste generation.

7. Ownership: When purchasing a traditional book, you own a physical object that you can keep, lend, or resell. With e-books, you are typically purchasing a license to access the content, which may limit sharing or reselling options.
