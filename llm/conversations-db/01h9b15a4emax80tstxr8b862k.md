**Prompt:**
Access different clipboard items in the history


**Response:**
Sure, you can access different clipboard items in the history using Klipper, the clipboard manager in KDE Plasma. 

To access the clipboard history, you can either click on the clipboard icon in the system tray and select "Show Clipboard History" or use the shortcut key Alt + Shift + V. 

Once the clipboard history is visible, you can scroll through the list of items. Each item will display the content that was copied or cut, along with a timestamp. 

To paste a specific item from the history, simply click on it, and it will be pasted at the current cursor position. 

If you need more information or have any other questions, please let me know!
