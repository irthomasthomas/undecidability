**Prompt:**
In github markdown text block wrap text

**Response:**
You can wrap text in a text block in GitHub Markdown by adding two or more spaces at the end of each line. Here is an example:

```
This is a long text that needs to be wrapped in a text block.
To achieve this, we add two spaces at the end of each line.
This allows the text to wrap and maintain the formatting.
```

When rendered, it will look like this:

This is a long text that needs to be wrapped in a text block.  
To achieve this, we add two spaces at the end of each line.  
This allows the text to wrap and maintain the formatting.

**Prompt:**
Fix this then:\nIf I were requesting this to a software development team or a developer, I would say:

"In the context of designing our shell scripts, I propose we aim to use logical operators
for conditional checks, particularly in situations where the logic is straightforward.  
Specifically, I like the concise and compact nature of short-circuit evaluation involving && and || operators.  

For instance, consider replacing traditional if-then-else constructs with their equivalent logical operator expressions where it's appropriate. A good example can be shown when comparing two variables, we could use [ "$a" = "$b" ] && echo "$b" || echo "$a" as an alternative to a multi-line if-then-else construct.  

Please keep in mind, the proposed style can improve conciseness but may reduce readability for complex conditions. In such cases, adhering to the traditional if-then-else-fi structure may be more suitable. Thus, use your best judgement based on the situation and prioritize code clarity and maintainability."  

This communicates the request clearly while also considering potential downsides and leaving room for the development team's discretion based on the specifics of the situation.'

**Prompt:**
Sure, but the lines don't wrap, thats all.

**Response:**
I apologize for that. To wrap the text, you can add two or more spaces at the end of each line where you want the line to break. Here is the corrected version:

```

```

Now the text is properly wrapped and formatted.
