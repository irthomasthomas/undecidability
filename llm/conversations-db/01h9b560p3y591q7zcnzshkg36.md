**Prompt:**
Add one sentence description on same line for each.

**Response:**
1. Singleton - Ensures that only a single instance of a class is created and provides a global access point to that instance.
2. Observer - Defines a one-to-many dependency between objects, so that when one object changes state, all its dependents are notified and updated automatically.
3. Factory - Creates objects without specifying the exact class to be instantiated.
4. Strategy - Defines a family of algorithms, encapsulates each one, and makes them interchangeable.
5. Decorator - Dynamically adds additional behavior to an object at runtime without changing its structure.
6. Adapter - Converts the interface of a class into another interface that clients expect.
7. Command - Encapsulates a request as an object, thereby allowing clients to parameterize clients with queues, requests, and operations.
8. Composite - Composes objects into tree structures to represent part-whole hierarchies, where each object can be treated individually or as a group.
9. Template Method - Defines the skeleton of an algorithm in a superclass and allows subclasses to override specific steps of the algorithm without changing its structure.
10. Iterator - Provides a way to access the elements of an aggregate object sequentially without exposing its underlying representation.
11. Visitor - Separates an algorithm from an object structure by moving the algorithm into a separate object and allowing the object structure to be traversed by accepting the visitor object.
12. Proxy - Provides a surrogate or placeholder for another object to control access to it.
13. Prototype - Creates new objects by cloning existing ones, avoiding the need for explicit instantiation.
14. Flyweight - Minimizes memory usage by sharing common data across multiple objects.
15. Mediator - Defines an object that encapsulates how a set of objects interact, promoting loose coupling between these objects.
16. Memento - Captures and restores an object's internal state without violating encapsulation.
17. Bridge - Decouples an abstraction from its implementation, enabling them to vary independently.
18. Facade - Provides a simplified interface to a complex subsystem, making it easier to use.
19. State - Allows an object to alter its behavior when its internal state changes.
20. Chain of Responsibility - Allows a request to be passed through a chain of objects until it is handled by one of them.
21. Interpreter - Defines a representation for grammar of a language, along with an interpreter that uses the representation to interpret sentences in the language.
22. Builder - Separates the construction of a complex object from its representation, allowing the same construction process to create different representations.
23. Data Access Object (DAO) - Provides an abstract interface to access a database, hiding the underlying implementation details.
24. Model-View-Controller (MVC) - Separates the representation of data (Model), user interface (View), and control logic (Controller) in an application.
25. Model-View-ViewModel (MVVM) - Separates the user interface (View), presentation logic (ViewModel), and data (Model) in an application, allowing them to evolve independently.
26. Publish-Subscribe - Defines a one-to-many dependency between objects, so that when one object changes state, all its dependents are notified and updated automatically.
27. Dependency Injection - Provides a way to pass the dependencies of an object externally, rather than having the object create or find its own dependencies.
28. Object Pool - Creates and manages a pool of reusable objects, which can be shared by multiple clients.
29. Front Controller - Provides a centralized entry point for handling requests and managing the flow of an application.
30. Null Object - Provides a default implementation of an interface or abstract class, to avoid null checks and enhance code readability and maintainability.

**Prompt:**
Briefer. And add Ternary to your list

**Response:**
1. Singleton - Ensures only one instance of a class exists and allows global access.
2. Observer - Notifies dependent objects when the state of an object changes.
3. Factory - Creates objects without specifying their concrete classes.
4. Strategy - Defines interchangeable algorithms or behaviors.
5. Decorator - Adds additional behavior to an object dynamically.
6. Adapter - Converts the interface of one class to another expected by the client.
7. Command - Encapsulates a request as an object.
8. Composite - Represents objects in a part-whole hierarchy.
9. Template Method - Defines the skeleton of an algorithm, with certain steps to be overridden by subclasses.
10. Iterator - Provides a way to access elements of a collection sequentially.
11. Visitor - Separates an algorithm from the object structure by traversing it with a separate visitor object.
12. Proxy - Provides a placeholder for an object and controls access to it.
13. Prototype - Creates new objects by cloning existing ones.
14. Flyweight - Shares common data across multiple objects, minimizing memory usage.
15. Mediator - Defines an object that coordinates communication between other objects.
16. Memento - Saves and restores an object's state without revealing its details.
17. Bridge - Decouples an abstraction from its implementation.
18. Facade - Provides a simplified interface to a complex system.
19. State - Allows an object to change its behavior depending on its internal state.
20. Chain of Responsibility - Handles a request by passing it through a chain of objects.
21. Interpreter - Defines a grammar for a language and parses sentences in that language.
22. Builder - Separates the construction of a complex object from its representation.
23. Data Access Object (DAO) - Provides an interface to access a database.
24. Model-View-Controller (MVC) - Separates data, user interface, and control logic in an application.
25. Model-View-ViewModel (MVVM) - Separates data, presentation logic, and user interface in an application.
26. Publish-Subscribe - Notifies multiple objects about changes in a certain object.
27. Dependency Injection - Passes dependencies to an object from external sources.
28. Object Pool - Creates and manages a pool of reusable objects.
29. Front Controller - Handles requests and manages application flow from a centralized location.
30. Null Object - Provides a default implementation for an interface or abstract class, to avoid null checks.


31. Ternary - Utilizes three operands to evaluate a condition and return different values based on the result.
