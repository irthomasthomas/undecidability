**Prompt:**
Name and describe, in one brief sentence 30 programming concepts, starting from Ternary\n

**Response:**
1. Ternary: A type of operator used in programming languages that takes three arguments, typically being a condition and two expressions for the condition results.
2. Variables: Variables are named memory locations that a program uses to store data temporarily.
3. Functions: Functions are blocks of reusable code that can perform a specific task when called within a program.
4. Loops: Loops are used to repeat a block of code multiple times until a certain condition is met.
5. Arrays: Arrays are used to store multiple values within a single variable in an ordered manner.
6. Hashmaps: Hashmaps or hash table can store data as key-value pairs, and it provides constant time complexity for search, insert and delete operations.
7. Recursion: Recursion is a method where the solution to a problem is based on solving smaller instances of the same problem.
8. Object-Oriented Programming: Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) is a paradigm based on the concept of 'objects', which can contain data and code.
9. Inheritance: Inheritance is a feature in OOP where an object or class is based on another object or class, using the same implementation.
10. Polymorphism: Polymorphism is a feature in OOP that allows objects to take on many forms, depending on their data type or class.
11. Regular Expression: Regular Expression (Regex) is a sequence of characters used for pattern matching in strings.
12. Conditionals: Conditionals are statements that are used to perform different actions based on different conditions.
13. Binary Trees: Binary Trees are a type of tree data structure where each node has at most two children.
14. Stacks: A stack is a data structure that follows the LIFO (Last In First Out) method i.e., the last inserted element is removed first.
15. Queues: A queue is a data structure that follows the FIFO (First In First Out) principle.
16. Encapsulation: Encapsulation is a concept where the data and methods are wrapped up together within a class.
17. Immutability: Immutability is a concept where a variable cannot be changed after it's declared.
18. Linked Lists: A linked list is a data structure that includes a series of connected nodes where each node contains data and the address of the next node.
19. Graphs: Graphs are non-linear data structures that consist of nodes and arcs.
20. Heaps: A Heap is a special type of binary tree that follows certain properties.
21. Exception Handling: Exception handling provides a way to handle errors and exceptions during runtime.
22. Multithreading: Multithreading is the execution of multiple threads simultaneously.
23. Concurrency: Concurrency is the execution of multiple instruction sequences at the same time.
24. Generics: Generics allow methods and classes to be parameterized by type(s).
25. Pointers: Pointers are variables that hold the memory address of another variable.
26. Composition: Composition is a way to combine simple objects to create more complex ones.
27. Type Conversion: Type conversion, or casting, converts a variable from one data type to another.
28. Bit Manipulation: Bit Manipulation involves direct manipulation of bits of data.
29. Garbage Collection: Garbage collection is the process in which the program's heap memory is automatically cleaned up and freed.
30. Prototyping: Prototyping refers to the development of incomplete versions of the software program being developed to check the feasibility and function of different parts of the software.
