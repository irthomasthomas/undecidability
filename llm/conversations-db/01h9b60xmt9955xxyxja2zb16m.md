**Prompt:**
Concurrency vs Multithreading

**Response:**
Concurrency and multithreading are both concepts used to achieve parallelism in computing, but they refer to slightly different approaches.

Concurrency is a broader concept that refers to the ability of a system to execute multiple tasks at the same time. It is designed to improve overall system performance and responsiveness by allowing multiple tasks to make progress, even if they are not executed simultaneously. Concurrency can be achieved using various techniques such as multitasking, multiprocessing, or multithreading.

Multithreading, on the other hand, is a specific implementation technique used within a single process to execute multiple threads concurrently. A thread is an individual sequence of programmed instructions that can be executed independently of other threads within the same process. Multithreading allows for parallel execution of different parts of a program, where each thread can perform a separate task simultaneously. Threads within a process share the same memory space, which enables them to communicate and synchronize data easily.

In summary, concurrency is a higher-level concept that refers to the ability of a system to execute multiple tasks simultaneously, while multithreading is a specific implementation technique used within a single process to achieve concurrency by executing multiple threads concurrently.
