**Prompt:**
Perform a strict fact check on the definitions below. Only list problems. If they are all correct then just summarise, don't repeat the whole list. \n\n48. Short-circuit: A behavior in logical operations where the second operand is not evaluated if the outcome can be determined by the first operand.
49. Callback: A function that is passed as an argument to another function and is executed at a later point in time.
50. Memory Management: The process of allocating and deallocating memory during the execution of a program.
51. Dynamic Programming: A technique in computer science where complex problems are solved by breaking them down into smaller overlapping subproblems.
52. Compilation: The process of translating source code into machine-readable instructions.
53. Interpreted Language: A programming language that is directly executed without the need for prior compilation.
54. Concurrency Control: Techniques used to manage access and modification of shared resources in concurrent programs.
55. Database: An organized collection of data that can be easily accessed, managed, and updated.
56. API (Application Programming Interface): A set of rules and protocols that allow different software applications to communicate and interact with each other.
57. Version Control: The management of changes to source code over time using tools such as Git.
58. Big O notation: A mathematical notation used to describe the complexity of algorithms in terms of time and space requirements.
59. Software Design Patterns: Reusable solutions to common design problems in software development.
60. Event-driven Programming: A programming paradigm where the flow of program execution is determined by events and event handlers.
61. MVC (Model View Controller): An architectural design pattern separating an application into three interconnected components: the model, the view, and the controller.
62. Dependency Injection: A design pattern where objects are passed their dependencies rather than creating them internally.
63. Testing Framework: A software tool or library that provides pre-defined structures and functions to automate the testing process.
64. Continuous Integration: The practice of regularly merging code changes from multiple developers into a shared repository, followed by automated build and test processes.
65. Machine Learning: A field of study that gives computers the ability to learn and make decisions based on data without being explicitly programmed.
66. Artificial Intelligence: A branch of computer science that deals with the development of intelligent machines capable of simulating human-like behaviors.
67. Web Development: The creation and maintenance of websites and web applications.
68. Mobile Development: The creation and maintenance of mobile applications for smartphones and tablets.
69. UX/UI Design: The process of enhancing user satisfaction by improving the usability, accessibility, and overall experience of interacting with a digital product.
70. Agile Development: An iterative and collaborative approach to software development that promotes flexibility, adaptability, and customer satisfaction.
71. Functional Programming: A programming paradigm that treats computation as the evaluation of mathematical functions and avoids changing state and mutable data.
72. Data Structures: The organization, management, and storage of data in a computer's memory.!
