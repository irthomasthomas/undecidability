Return the writing with spelling fixed:\n\n:While thinking about options for fine-tuning chatgpt-3.5 on a budget, it occured to me that you can easily parse the incoming response for the break or newline char and then cancel the generation after a number of sentances or paragraphs. You could then pass the generated portion to a cheaper model to continue. My understanding of GPT-4, based on rumors, is that it's ensemble of about 8 GPT3.5s, fine-tuned on different subjects. In fact, chatgpt3.5 is also thought to be an ensenble of sorts, perhaps just 2 models vs 8? But they all ultimately rely on the same base model. It should be possible to get GPT4 performance in 3.5 with fine tuning. The difference between 3.5 and 4 is usually around 10-15% in zero-shot benchmarks. Other tests have scored GPT4 higher, but then they didn't use plain zero-shot prompts, so the comparison is not a fair one.
