**Prompt:**
Fact check: There is no limit to the number of labels you can create for github issues on the free account

**Response:**
This statement is incorrect. 

On GitHub's free account, there is a limit of 50 labels that you can create for issues. If you want to create more labels, you need to either delete some existing labels or upgrade to a paid plan, such as GitHub Pro or GitHub Team, which offer unlimited labels.
