**Prompt:**
Fact check: There is no limit to the number of labels you can create for github issues on the free account

**Response:**
The fact that there is no limit to the number of labels you can create for GitHub issues on the free account is incorrect. 

As of March 16, 2022, GitHub's official documentation states that there is a limit of 1000 labels per repository for all account types, including free accounts. This means that you can create up to 1000 labels for issues in a single repository.

Please note that GitHub's policies and limitations are subject to change, so it is always a good idea to refer to their official documentation for the most up-to-date information.
