**Prompt:**
Fact check: There is no limit to the number of labels you can create for github issues on the free account

**Response:**
This statement is not entirely accurate. While it is true that GitHub does not have a hard limit on the number of labels you can create for issues, there is a limit on the total number of labels allowed on a repository, regardless of the account type.

GitHub allows a maximum of 250 labels per repository, including both default and custom labels. This limit applies to both free and paid accounts.

If you reach the label limit, you will need to remove some labels or consolidate them to make room for new ones.
