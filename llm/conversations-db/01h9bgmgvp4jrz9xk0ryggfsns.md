**Prompt:**
Fact check: There is no limit to the number of labels you can create for github issues on the free account

**Response:**
Claim: There is no limit to the number of labels you can create for GitHub issues on the free account.

Fact check: Mostly false.

Explanation: GitHub's official documentation states that while there is no limit to the number of labels you can create, there is a limit to the total amount of labels that can be applied to an issue. On both free and paid accounts, each issue can have up to a maximum of 100 labels applied to it.

Therefore, while you can create as many labels as you want, you cannot apply more than 100 labels to a single issue, regardless of your GitHub account type.
