**Prompt:**
Attribution in markdown

**Response:**
In markdown, you can provide attribution by using the greater-than symbol (`>`) at the beginning of a line. This is commonly known as a blockquote.

For example:

```
> This is a quote by John Doe.
```

This will display the text as a blockquote with John Doe attributed as the source. You can also add additional lines to the blockquote by inserting the greater-than symbol at the beginning of each line.

Additionally, you can specify the author within the blockquote by using the `cite` attribute.

For example:

```
> This is a quote by John Doe.
> 
> - John Doe
```

This will display the quote and attribute John Doe as the author below the quote.
