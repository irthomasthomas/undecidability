**Prompt:**
Attribution in markdown

**Response:**
Attributing work in markdown can be done through a couple of methods:

1. **Citations:** You can simply cite your source in the text. For example: `According to [source](url), ...`
2. **Blockquotes:** If the attribution includes direct quotes or large sections of text, blockquotes can be used. To do this in markdown, you use the `>` character. For example: 

```
> This is a quote from the source. 
> - [source](url)
```
It indents the quoted section and helps it stand apart from the rest of the text.

3. **Footnotes:** Markdown also supports the use of footnotes for attributions. Here's an example:

```
According to the source[^1]...

[^1]: [source](url)
```
The `[^1]` creates a footnote reference, and the `[^1]: [source](url)` creates the footnote itself. However, please note that the support for footnotes can vary depending on the specific platform you're using to render your markdown.

4. **Images:** If you are attributing images, you can place the attribution text immediately below the image in italics (using asterisks `*` or underscores `_`). For example: 

```
![alt text for image](url)
*Image: [source](url)*
```
