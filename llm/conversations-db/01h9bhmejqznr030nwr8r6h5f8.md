**Prompt:**
markdown alt text on code block?

**Response:**
In Markdown, it is not possible to directly add alt text to a code block. Alt text is typically used with images to provide a text alternative for those who cannot see the image.

However, if you want to add a description or explanation for a code block, you can do so by adding a heading or paragraph immediately before or after the code block to provide context or explanation.
