**Prompt:**
markdown alt text on code block?

**Response:**
In Markdown, there is no standard way to add alt text to a code block. The `alt` attribute is typically used with `img` tags in HTML to provide alternative information for an image, if a user for some reason cannot view it (because they have turned off images in their web browser, are using a screen reader due to visual impairment, etc.).

In a markdown document, you can add comments for your code block to give more context or provide a description of what the code does. However, these comments will be visible to all users, not just those who are unable to view the code block.

For example, you can add comments to your code block like this:

```javascript
// This is a simple Javascript function that logs 'Hello, World!' to the console
function helloWorld() {
    console.log("Hello, World!");
}
```

Or for python:

```python
# This is a simple Python function that prints 'Hello, World!' to the console
def hello_world():
    print("Hello, World!")
```

But please note these are comments within the code block, not an alt text equivalent. As previously mentioned, markdown does not support alt text on code blocks.
