**Prompt:**
Familial form

**Response:**
Familial form refers to a type or pattern of inheritance in which a genetic trait or disease is passed down within a family. It is also known as familial inheritance or familial pattern. This means that the trait or disease is more common within certain families and there is a higher likelihood of it being inherited by offspring from affected family members.

Familial forms can apply to various genetic conditions, including both rare and common diseases. Some examples of familial forms of diseases include familial breast cancer, familial Alzheimer's disease, and familial hypercholesterolemia.

In these cases, individuals who have family members with the condition have an increased risk of developing it themselves compared to the general population. The mode of inheritance can vary, such as autosomal dominant inheritance (where an affected parent has a 50% chance of passing on the condition) or autosomal recessive inheritance (where both parents need to be carriers for the trait to be passed on).

Understanding the familial form of a trait or disease can help in genetic counseling, family planning, and early detection or prevention strategies for individuals at higher risk. Genetic testing and family history analysis are typically used to determine if a trait or disease has a familial form.
