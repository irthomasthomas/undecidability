**Prompt:**
What is called when someone tries to fix the error, or asks for help on stackexchange about an error, when they should be explaining their goal?

**Response:**
The concept you are referring to is known as the XY problem. It occurs when someone attempts to solve a specific issue (X) by asking for help on a specific solution (Y), rather than explaining their overall goal or underlying problem. In such cases, the person may be focusing too much on what they think the solution should be, instead of providing sufficient context or information that would facilitate a better solution.
