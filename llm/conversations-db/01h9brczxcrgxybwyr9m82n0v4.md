**Prompt:**
Explain concisely the XY problem in programming and computing.

**Response:**
The XY problem refers to a situation where someone asks for help with solving problem X, but instead of seeking assistance with the actual underlying issue, they ask for advice on a specific solution Y that they think will solve problem X. In this context, people tend to focus on a particular approach or solution without adequately explaining their initial problem, thus hindering the problem-solving process.
