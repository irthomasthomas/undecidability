**Prompt:**
XY Problem: when someone 

**Response:**
asks for help with Problem X, but they are actually trying to solve Problem Y. They may have already come up with a solution for Problem Y but are unsure if it is the best approach. Instead of asking directly for help with Problem Y, they ask about Problem X, hoping someone will suggest their preconceived solution for Problem Y. However, this can lead to inefficient and ineffective solutions because the true problem (Problem Y) is not being addressed directly.
