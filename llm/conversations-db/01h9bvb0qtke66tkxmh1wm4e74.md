**Prompt:**
What if I want to do more complex things, like requesting a diff when a file changed, and automated triaging of change notifications.? How would that architecture hold up?

**Response:**
The architecture you are using should be able to hold up potentially with some enhancements. Here's how you could go about each of your needs:

1. Requesting a diff when a file changes: This might require a script or program that checks for differences in file structure or content. It's essentially a file comparison algorithm that would check the current version of the file against its previous state. This might imply storing file states with timestamps or using a version control system that automatically does it. It would be helpful to use platforms like GitHub which have in-built functionalities for such requirements.

2. Automated triaging of change notifications: This requires a system that effectively categorizes and prioritizes change notifications based on a set of rules or algorithms. This might mean associating severity or priority levels to certain types of changes. You'd need to build mechanisms to classify these changes and then transmit relevant notifications. Tools like Jira, Freshdesk, Zendesk allow for customization of such alert rules in case you're dealing with a huge volume of change requests.

To conclude, with added capabilities, your architecture should be able to handle these tasks, but considerations regarding data storage, processing power, and potentially other resource constraints should be made. Additionally, the availability and integration of third-party tools could significantly simplify the process. Make sure to tweak the architecture as per the specific needs.
