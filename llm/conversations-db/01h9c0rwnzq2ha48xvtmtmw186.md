**Prompt:**
'The command: grep "shot-scraper" ~/.zhistory | fzf --preview 'echo {}' | awk '{print $2}' | xclip -selection clipboard does not work quite right. It copies the datetime but not the command. Here is what the entries look like in .zhistory:
1693476157:0;shot-scraper html "https://explosion.ai/blog/bloom-embeddings"

: 1693589884:0;gh repo view | shot-scraper'

**Response:**
The issue with the command not copying the command itself is likely due to the way the command is piped through different utilities. Let's break down the command and see where the problem might be:

1. `grep "shot-scraper" ~/.zhistory`: This command filters the contents of the `.zhistory` file for lines containing the string "shot-scraper".

2. `fzf --preview 'echo {}'`: The output from the previous command is then passed to `fzf`, which provides an interactive fuzzy finder for selecting a line. The preview option shows the line using `echo {}`.

3. `awk '{print $2}'`: After selecting a line, `awk` is used to print the second field, which is the datetime.

4. `xclip -selection clipboard`: Finally, the datetime is copied to the clipboard using `xclip`.

The problem is that the command itself is not being maintained throughout the pipeline. To fix this, we need to modify the command slightly to keep the command intact during the process. Here's an updated command:

```bash
grep "shot-scraper" ~/.zhistory | fzf --print-query --preview 'echo {}' | awk -F ';' '{print $2}' | xargs -I {} sh -c 'echo "{}" | awk -F " " "{ print \$NF }" | xclip -selection clipboard'
```

Explanation of changes:
- `--print-query` option is passed to `fzf` to print the selected entry including the search query.

- `awk -F ';' '{print $2}'` is used to extract the command part after the first semicolon.

- `xargs -I {} sh -c 'echo "{}" | awk -F " " "{ print \$NF }" | xclip -selection clipboard'` is used to execute following pipeline for each selected entry:
  - With `echo "{}"`, the command itself is passed to the next step.
  - Then `awk -F " " "{ print \$NF }"` prints the last field of the command, essentially removing the leading datetime and semicolon.
  - Finally, `xclip -selection clipboard` copies the extracted command to the clipboard.

This updated command should preserve the original command and copy it to the clipboard along with the datetime.

**Prompt:**
I only need the command string after the 0;

**Response:**
Apologies for the confusion. If you only need the command string after the "0;", you can modify the command as follows:

```bash
grep "shot-scraper" ~/.zhistory | awk -F ":0;" '{print $2}' | fzf --preview 'echo {}' | awk '{print $2}' | xclip -selection clipboard
```

Explanation:
- `grep "shot-scraper" ~/.zhistory` filters the lines containing the string "shot-scraper".
- `awk -F ":0;" '{print $2}'` extracts the command string after "0;".
- The output is then passed to `fzf` for selecting a line interactively.
- `--preview 'echo {}'` shows the preview of the selected line using `echo {}`.
- `awk '{print $2}'` extracts the datetime.
- Finally, `xclip -selection clipboard` copies the extracted datetime to the clipboard.

By modifying the position of `awk -F ":0;" '{print $2}'`, the command string after "0;" is isolated and passed to the subsequent pipeline.
