**Prompt:**
In manjaro arch linux and grub, How do I check if relatime or noatime are set?

**Response:**
To check if relatime or noatime are set in Manjaro Arch Linux, you can follow these steps:

1. Open the terminal by pressing Ctrl+Alt+T or searching for "Terminal" in the application launcher.
2. Type the following command to open the `/etc/fstab` file in a text editor:
```
sudo nano /etc/fstab
```
3. Enter your password if prompted.
4. Look for the line(s) that correspond to the mount point(s) you want to check. These lines will start with `/dev/` or `UUID=`.
5. On the line(s) you found, look for the options column, which is denoted by the fourth field (separated by spaces or tabs).
6. If the `relatime` or `noatime` option is present, it means it is enabled. If it is not present, it means the default option is being used.
7. Once you have finished checking the options, press Ctrl+X to exit the editor.
8. If you made any changes, press Y and then Enter to save the file.
9. Restart your system for the changes to take effect.

Note that `/etc/fstab` is a system file, and modifying it without proper knowledge can lead to system instability or errors. Make sure to exercise caution while editing this file.
