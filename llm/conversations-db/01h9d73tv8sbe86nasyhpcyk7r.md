#Computing #Compsci #Ubuntu #Linux #Manjaro #Arch #Opensource #Programming #Learning #KDE #Plasma #Dolphin #Vim \n\n I am working on a new manjaro linux kde desktop. Help me organise my files. I am working in the terminal, so you just tell me what command you want me to run to start to get the information you need.


**Response:**
Sure! To help you organize your files, I'll need to gather some information about your current file structure. Let's start with the following commands:

1. `ls`: This command lists all the files and directories in your current working directory. Please run this command and let me know the output.

2. `pwd`: This command displays the current working directory. Please run this command and share the output with me.

With this information, I can guide you on how to organize your files effectively.

**Response:**
Great! Now that we have the information about your current file structure, let's proceed with organizing your files.

Here are a few suggestions for organizing your files based on the information you provided:

1. Create a directory for your projects: Since you already have a "Development" directory, you can use that to keep all your project-related files. You can create subdirectories within "Development" to further categorize the projects if needed.

   ```shell
   mkdir ~/Development
   ```

2. Sort files into appropriate directories: You have several directories like "Apps," "Books," "Documents," "Downloads," "Music," "Pictures," "Public," "Templates," and "Videos." You can go through each of these directories and move the respective files into the appropriate folders. For example, move music files to the "Music" directory, pictures to the "Pictures" directory, etc.

   ```shell
   mv <filename> <destination_directory_path>
   ```

3. Utilize the "bin" directory: You already have a "Bin" directory, which is commonly used to store executable files or scripts. You can place any scripts or executables you have in this directory to keep them organized.

4. Create a directory for temporary files or downloads: If you frequently download files or have temporary files, you can create a dedicated directory for them to keep your Downloads directory organized.

   ```shell
   mkdir ~/Downloads/tmp
   ```

These are just a few suggestions to help you get started. You can customize your file organization based on your specific needs and preferences. Let me know if you need further assistance or have any specific requirements!
