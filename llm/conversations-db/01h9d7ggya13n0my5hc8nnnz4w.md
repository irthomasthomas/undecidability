**Prompt:**
#Computing #Compsci #Ubuntu #Linux #Manjaro #Arch #Opensource #Programming #Learning #KDE #Plasma #Dolphin #Vim \n\n I am working on a new manjaro linux kde desktop. Help me organise my files. I am working in the terminal, so you just tell me what command you want me to run to start to get the information you need. Always ask me to describe what a dir path contains, and remember that for the full path.

**Response:**
Sure, I can help you organize your files in the terminal. Let's start by using the `ls` command to list the contents of a directory. 

To get information about a specific directory, please provide the directory path. For example, if you want to explore the contents of the home directory, you can run:

```
ls ~
```

Similarly, if you want to explore the contents of a different directory, replace the tilde (~) with the desired path.

Please provide the directory path you would like for us to start organizing and describe its contents.
