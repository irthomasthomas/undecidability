**Prompt:**
What is the exact zsh command to: list a files tags?


**Response:**
There is no built-in command in zsh to list file tags. However, you can use the `mdls` command on macOS to list the tags of a file. Here's the command:

```zsh
mdls -name kMDItemUserTags <file_path>
```

Replace `<file_path>` with the path to the file you want to list the tags for.
