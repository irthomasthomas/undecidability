**Prompt:**
In KDE Plasma 5 running on manjaro (Arch) linux, how do I list the xdg
file tags, like dolphin uses? In the terminal

**Response:**
To list the XDG file tags in KDE Plasma 5, you can use the `balooctl` command-line tool. `balooctl` is a command-line interface for Baloo, the file indexing and search framework used by KDE Plasma.

Here's how you can list the XDG file tags in the terminal:

1. Open a terminal.
   - You can open a terminal by pressing `Ctrl + Alt + T` or by searching for "Terminal" in the application launcher.
2. Run the following command:
   ```
   balooctl tags
   ```
   This command will list all the XDG file tags available on your system.

That's it! Now you should see a list of the XDG file tags, just like Dolphin uses.
