 Write a jq query set variables datetime, conversation_id, model, prompt, response\n\n

**Response:**
Here is the jq query to extract the variables datetime, conversation_id, model, prompt, and response from the given JSON:

```jq
.[].datetime_utc as $datetime | .[].conversation_id as $conversation_id | .[].model as $model | .[].prompt as $prompt | .[].response as $response | [$datetime, $conversation_id, $model, $prompt, $response]
```

This will output an array with the values of the variables:

```
[
  "2023-09-03T10:34:18.465893",
  "01h9d9qgcb97rf0ddkfpz19bge",
  "gpt-3.5-turbo",
  "Goal Oriented Userinterface",
  "A goal-oriented user interface is a..."
]
```

Note: The response contains the complete text and has been truncated for readability.

**Response:**
I apologize for the confusion. It seems that the provided command is not returning the expected output. Here's an alternative approach to extract the required variables using jq:

```bash
llm logs list --cid "01h9d9qgcb97rf0ddkfpz19bge" --json | jq '.[] | [.datetime_utc, .conversation_id, .model, .prompt, .response]'
```

This command retrieves the logs for the specified conversation ID and uses jq to extract the datetime_utc, conversation_id, model, prompt, and response from each log entry.

Please execute this command in your terminal and let me know if you encounter any issues.

 great, heres the output. How do I access each entry individualy?

**Response:**
To access each entry individually from the output, you can use the indexing feature of most programming languages. Assuming you have stored the output in a variable called `output`, you can access each entry as follows:

```python
datetime = output[0]
conversation_id = output[1]
model = output[2]
prompt = output[3]
response = output[4]
```

Now you can use these variables as needed in your code. Alternatively, you can directly access the entries in the output using their index, like `output[0]` for the datetime value, `output[1]` for the conversation_id value, and so on.

Please note that the indexing starts from 0, so the first entry is at index 0, the second entry is at index 1, and so on. Adjust the index accordingly based on the programming language you are using.
