**Prompt:**
Explain ~~~~    ruby startline=3 $%@#$
def foo(x)
  return 3
end
~~~~~~~

**Response:**
The given code snippet is in the Ruby programming language. It defines a function named `foo` with a parameter `x`. The function body simply contains a return statement that returns the integer value `3`. The `~` characters at the beginning and end of the code are not part of the code itself and do not have any significance in the Ruby language. They might be used as decorative separators or formatting markers in the context where the code snippet is placed. The `ruby startline=3 $%@#$` part is not valid syntax in Ruby and seems to be some placeholder text or annotations unrelated to the actual code.
