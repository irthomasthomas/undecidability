**Prompt:**
see the log of which packages where just updated?

**Response:**
Unfortunately, `pipx` does not provide a built-in feature to view a log of which packages were just updated. However, you can manually check the updates by running `pipx list`, which will display all the installed packages along with their versions. By comparing the before and after versions, you can determine which packages were updated.
