**Prompt:**
Replace the body of an github issue using gh cli? Or no?

**Response:**
Yes, it is possible to replace the body of a GitHub issue using the `gh` CLI (GitHub CLI).

To replace the body of an existing GitHub issue, you can use the following command:

```shell
gh issue edit <issue_number>
```

Replace `<issue_number>` with the number of the issue you want to modify. This command will open a text editor where you can edit the issue body. Save and close the editor to update the issue on GitHub.

Note: Ensure that you have the `gh` CLI installed and authenticated with your GitHub account before using this command.
