**Prompt:**
It occured to me just, that the experience of the average house cat is not too dissimilar from that of the (misslabeled) ADHD human. The cat uses all its skills in stalking and hunting to bring home to its human the greatest gift a cat could give. One plump and juicy mouse, so fresh that it tries to get away, giving the happy cat an opportunity to demonstrate his skills before his human. And what reward does the cat receive for it's victory? It gets yelled at and chased out of the house, and the prize that was so hard won, discarded as so much chaf. The cat is a hunter. It's function is to explore, stalk, and hunt, and bring home the prey to it's hungry family.  The adhd human is a hunter-gatherer. We lock eyes on our prey and stalk it where ever it leads. The danger and significance of the hunt focuses the mind. Where once there was a constant stream of thoughts fighting for attention, all demanding to be organised and prioritiesed, but every idea seems just as important, just as urgent, and every new idea triggers a ...

**Response:**
... surge of excitement and energy. Like the cat, the ADHD human thrives on the thrill of the chase, constantly seeking new stimulation and challenges. However, society often fails to recognize or appreciate this unique perspective.

Just as the cat's gift of a mouse is seen as a nuisance, the ADHD individual's enthusiasm and creativity can be misunderstood and overshadowed by societal expectations of focus and conformity. The cat may be scolded for its instinctual behavior, and the ADHD human may be chastised for their difficulty in maintaining attention or following traditional structures.

But what if instead of dismissing these natural inclinations, we embrace and channel them? What if we nurture the hunter-gatherer spirit within the ADHD individual and provide outlets for their energy and curiosity?

By encouraging their innate drive for exploration and hunting, we can tap into their untapped potential. Rather than trying to fit them into a predetermined mold, we can empower them to embrace their uniqueness and utilize their skills in meaningful ways.

Imagine a world where the ADHD individual is recognized and celebrated for their ability to think outside the box, to take risks, and to adapt quickly to changing circumstances. A world where their unconventional approach is valued, and their contributions are acknowledged.

It is time we redefine our perception of ADHD and recognize its strengths. It is not a flaw or a disorder, but a different way of experiencing the world. Let us embrace the hunter-gatherer within us all, and create a society that celebrates diversity, creativity, and the thrill of the chase.
