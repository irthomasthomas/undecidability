Fix spelling tweak the language of this unfinished paragraph:\n\nIt occured to me just, that the experience of the average house cat is not too dissimilar from that of the (misslabeled) ADHD human. The cat uses all its skills in stalking and hunting to bring home to its human the greatest gift a cat could give. One plump and juicy mouse, so fresh that it tries to get away, giving the happy cat an opportunity to demonstrate his skills before his human. And what reward does the cat receive for it's victory? It gets yelled at and chased out of the house, and the prize that was so hard won, discarded as so much chaf. The cat is a hunter. It's function is to explore, stalk, and hunt, and bring home the prey to it's hungry family.  The adhd human is a hunter-gatherer. We lock eyes on our prey and stalk it where ever it leads. The danger and significance of the hunt focuses the mind. Where once there was a constant stream of thoughts fighting for attention, all demanding to be organised and prioritiesed, but every idea seems just as important, just as urgent, and every new idea triggers a ...

The cat uses all its skills in stalking and hunting to bring home the greatest gift a cat could give: a plump and juicy mouse, so fresh that it tries to escape, providing the happy cat with an opportunity to demonstrate its skills before its human. However, what reward does the cat receive for its victory? It gets yelled at and chased out of the house, and the hard-won prize is discarded as mere trash. The cat is a hunter. Its function is to explore, stalk, hunt, and bring home prey to its hungry family. On the other hand, the ADHD human is a hunter-gatherer. We fixate on our prey and pursue it wherever it leads. The danger and importance of the hunt sharpens our focus. In the past, there was a constant stream of thoughts competing for attention, all demanding to be organized and prioritized, each idea seeming equally crucial and pressing. Each new idea triggered a...

**Prompt:**
Slightly more formal, like a 19th century scientist writing letters to the London philosophical society

**Response:**
It has come to my attention that the experiences of the typical domestic feline bear a striking resemblance to those of the erroneously categorized ADHD human. The cat employs its entire repertoire of talents in the art of stalking and hunting, bringing forth to its human guardian the most esteemed offering a feline can proffer â€“ a plump and succulent mouse, so freshly caught that it strives to elude capture, affording the elated cat an opportunity to showcase its prowess in the presence of its human companion. Yet, what reward does the cat enjoy for its triumph? Instead, it is met with rebuke and expulsion from the abode, while the cherished spoils, which were so arduously obtained, are hastily discarded as mere flotsam. The cat, by nature, is a tenacious hunter. Its purpose is to explore, trail, and seize prey, delivering it to its famished kin. In a similar vein, the ADHD human exemplifies the archetype of the hunter-gatherer. We focus our gaze resolutely upon our quarry, pursuing it relentlessly, wherever it may lead. The perils and import of the hunt sharpen our cognitive faculties. Once burdened by a ceaseless deluge of thoughts vying for attention, each clamoring to be arranged and prioritized, with each notion seeming equally momentous and urgent, each fresh idea sets off a cascading chain of...
