**Prompt:**
What does ls */ do in zsh and bash?

**Response:**
In both Zsh and Bash, the command `ls */` lists all the directories within the current directory. 

Here's an explanation of the command:
- `ls` is the command to list files and directories.
- `*/` is a glob pattern that matches all directories. The `*` matches any characters, and the trailing `/` specifies that it should match directories only.

So, when you run `ls */`, it will display a list of the directories present in the current directory.
