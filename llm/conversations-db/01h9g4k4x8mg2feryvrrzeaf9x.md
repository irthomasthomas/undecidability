**Prompt:**
What does ls */ do in zsh on manjaro(Arch) linux?

**Response:**
The command `ls */` in zsh on Manjaro (Arch) linux will list the contents of all directories in the current directory.

- `ls` is a command to list the files and directories.
- `*/` means all directories in the current directory. The `*` is a wildcard character that matches any pattern, and the `/` limits this pattern to directories only.

So combined, `ls */` is listing the contents of all directories in the current directory.
