 Think it through carefully. As an experienced linux programmer. Rewrite the following script, called Pomedoro.sh. When the user switches KDE Activities, pause the ffmpeg recording of the outgoing activity, and unpause the ffmpeg process in the new active activity. Unless the new activity does not already have an ffmpeg screen recording active, in which case, start the recording and log the process to the activity. There should always be exactly one screen-recording active at a time, and that will be the recording of the current active Activity\n\n

**Prompt:**
Are these good options for manjaro linux using Nvidia 3060 and Amd 5950x? Which settings are likely to use little or no cpu but still result in a small file size?

**Response:**
For screen recording on Manjaro Linux using Nvidia 3060 and AMD 5950X, you can use the following options for ffmpeg to minimize CPU usage and produce smaller file sizes:

1. Resolution: Use a lower screen resolution for recording, such as 1920x1080 instead of 4K, if it suits your needs. Lower resolution requires less CPU processing and results in smaller file sizes.

2. Frame Rate: Set a lower frame rate, such as 30 frames per second (fps), instead of 60 fps. Lower frame rate reduces the amount of data to be processed and ultimately results in smaller file sizes.

3. Codec: Choose an efficient video codec like H.264 (libx264) instead of a lossless codec like H.265 (libx265). H.264 strikes a good balance between file size and quality and is widely supported.

4. Bitrate: Set a lower bitrate to reduce the amount of data encoded per second. A bitrate between 1000-5000 kbps is generally reasonable for screen recordings, depending on the desired quality.

Here's an example command using these options:

```bash
ffmpeg -f x11grab -s 1920x1080 -r 30 -i :0.0 -c:v libx264 -preset ultrafast -crf 22 -pix_fmt yuv420p -b:v 5000k output.mp4
```

In this example, the screen resolution is set to 1920x1080, frame rate is 30 fps, codec is libx264, preset is ultrafast, constant rate factor (CRF) is 22, pixel format is yuv420p, and bitrate is 5000 kbps. Adjust these values according to your preferences and requirements.

Keep in mind that optimizing for smaller file sizes may affect the video quality to some extent. It's recommended to experiment with different settings to find the right balance between file size and quality that suits your needs.

**Prompt:**
Will that use the gpu?

**Response:**
The options provided in the previous response primarily focus on reducing CPU usage and file size. However, to utilize the GPU for encoding with ffmpeg, you can use the NVENC encoder provided by Nvidia.

To enable GPU encoding with NVENC, you need to ensure that your version of ffmpeg has been compiled with NVENC support. Manjaro Linux generally provides a package for ffmpeg compiled with NVENC support. You can install it using the package manager:

```bash
sudo pacman -S ffmpeg
```

Once you have the NVENC-enabled ffmpeg installed, you can utilize the GPU for encoding by specifying the `h264_nvenc` encoder instead of `libx264`. Here's an example command:

```bash
ffmpeg -f x11grab -s 1920x1080 -r 30 -i :0.0 -c:v h264_nvenc -preset llhp -b:v 5000k output.mp4
```

In this example, `h264_nvenc` is used as the video encoder and `llhp` is the preset, which stands for "low latency, high performance." You can adjust the preset according to your needs, keeping in mind that lower latency presets may result in larger file sizes.

By using NVENC, the GPU's hardware encoding capabilities will be leveraged, reducing the CPU load and potentially improving performance. However, the file size may still depend on the selected bitrate and the complexity of the content being recorded.

Remember to confirm that your Nvidia drivers are up to date to ensure proper functionality with NVENC.
