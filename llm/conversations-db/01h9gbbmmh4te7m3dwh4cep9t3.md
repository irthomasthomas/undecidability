**Prompt:**
How to use neovim on linux now that I have it installed

**Response:**
Once you have Neovim installed on Linux, you can open and start using it by following these steps:

1. Open a terminal: Launch a terminal window by pressing `Ctrl+Alt+T` or searching for "terminal" in your application launcher.

2. Start Neovim: Type `nvim` or `neovim` in the terminal and press `Enter`. This will start Neovim.

3. Neovim Interface: Neovim will open in the terminal window with a blank screen. You are now in normal mode, which allows you to navigate through your file using keyboard shortcuts. Here are a few basic commands to get you started:

   - To start editing, press `i` to enter insert mode. Now you can start typing in your file.
   - To exit insert mode and return to normal mode, press `Esc`.
   - To save your file, press `Esc` to ensure you are in normal mode, and then type `:w` and press `Enter`. This will save the file.
   - To exit Neovim, ensure you are in normal mode (`Esc`), then type `:q` and press `Enter`. If you have unsaved changes, you will need to type `:q!` to force quit without saving.

4. Customize Neovim: Neovim allows extensive customization through a configuration file named `init.vim`. The file resides in the `~/.config/nvim/` directory. You can edit this file with Neovim itself or any text editor to personalize your Neovim experience.

These were just the basics to get you started. Neovim has a plethora of features and plugins to explore as you gain more experience. To learn more about Neovim and its capabilities, you may refer to the official Neovim documentation or explore various online resources and communities.

**Prompt:**
Change neovim settings to better suit dvorak

**Response:**
To change Neovim settings to better suit the Dvorak keyboard layout, you can add key mappings specific to Dvorak in your Neovim configuration file. Here's how you can do it:

1. Open your Neovim configuration file:
   ```
   nvim ~/.config/nvim/init.vim
   ```

2. Add the following lines to remap keys for Dvorak layout:
   ```
   " Switch h, j, k, l with their respective positions on the Dvorak layout
   nnoremap h g
   nnoremap t h
   nnoremap n j
   nnoremap s k
   nnoremap i l
   ```

   This remaps the `h` key to `g`, `j` key to `n`, `k` key to `s`, and `l` key to `i`. 

3. Save and exit:
   Press `Esc` and type `:wq` to save the changes and exit the file.

4. Restart Neovim:
   Close any existing Neovim instance and reopen it for the changes to take effect.

Now you can use Neovim with the key mappings that are more suitable for the Dvorak layout. Modify these mappings or add additional ones as per your preferences to further customize your Neovim setup.

**Prompt:**
Are you sure that is right? Does that just change what up down left right are and not actually swapping key input?

**Response:**
You're right, I apologize for the confusion. The example changes the key bindings for navigation and not the actual keyboard layout within Neovim which I assumed is already set to Dvorak at the system level. 

If your system is already set to Dvorak, Neovim should respect that setting and you don't need to swap keys manually within Neovim. 

If you have set your keyboard layout to Dvorak, Neovim doesn't require any additional configuration since it just inherits the layout from your system setting. 

You might want to remap some keys for a better experience, for example, swapping `:` and `;` since you use `:` frequently in Vim and in Dvorak it's more accessible to type `;`. Here's how to do it:

```
noremap ; :
noremap : ;
```
Remember to add this to your `init.vim` configuration file. 

Either way, it's all down to personal preference. If you feel that any key is not at a comfortable position, you can always remap it using similar methods. You might want to check this [discussion](https://www.reddit.com/r/vim/comments/2jq6ed/using_vim_with_a_dvorak_layout/) on Reddit, where several users shared their experience of using Vim with a Dvorak layout.
