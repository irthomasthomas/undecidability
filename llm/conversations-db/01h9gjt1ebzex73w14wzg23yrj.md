 Think it through carefully. As an experienced linux programmer. Rewrite the following script, called Pomedoro.sh. When the user switches KDE Activities, pause the ffmpeg recording of the outgoing activity, and unpause the ffmpeg process in the new active activity. Unless the new activity does not already have an ffmpeg screen recording active, in which case, start the recording and log the process to the activity. There should always be exactly one screen-recording active at a time, and that will be the recording of the current active Activity\n\n

**Response:**
Here is a refactoring of your script with a single ffmpeg process being paused and unpaused. There are several ways to approach the task of pausing and resuming a process on a KDE activity switch and the method outlined may not meet your specific use case. Also, Error handling and expected edge-cases handling might require further modifications and improvements.

```bash
#!/bin/bash

# Declarating the variable to check the current activity
currentActivity=$(qdbus org.kde.ActivityManager /ActivityManager/Activities CurrentActivity)

# Store original ffmpeg pid in a file for reference
ffmpeg -video_size 1024x768 -framerate 25 -f x11grab -i :0.0+100,200 -f alsa -i hw:0 output.mkv & echo $! > /tmp/ffmpeg_$currentActivity.pid

while true; do
  # Get the currently active KDE activity
  newActivity=$(qdbus org.kde.ActivityManager /ActivityManager/Activities CurrentActivity)
      
  # Compare it with the old activity
  if [[ "$newActivity" != "$currentActivity" ]]; then
    # If the activities are different, pause the old recording and resume/start the new recording
    
    # Send stop signal to the ffmpeg process of the old activity
    kill -STOP $(cat /tmp/ffmpeg_$currentActivity.pid)

    # Check if the new activity already has a recording
    if [[ -e "/tmp/ffmpeg_$newActivity.pid" ]]; then
      # If it does, resume it
      kill -CONT $(cat /tmp/ffmpeg_$newActivity.pid)
    else
      # Else, start a new recording for it
      ffmpeg -video_size 1024x768 -framerate 25 -f x11grab -i :0.0+100,200 -f alsa -i hw:0 output_$newActivity.mkv & echo $! > /tmp/ffmpeg_$newActivity.pid
    fi

    # Update the recorded last activity
    currentActivity=$newActivity

  fi

  # Sleep for 2 seconds before checking again - this prevents excessively frequent checks, but can be adjusted to user's needs
  sleep 2
done
```

Note: The script assumes that the ffmpeg command provided is suitable for your requirements, you may need to modify it according to your needs.
