**Prompt:**
create a ramdisk in linux

**Response:**
Creating a RAM disk in Linux is beneficial when you want to have a super-fast disk implemented. This would use the actual RAM memory to simulate a disk drive. Please remember that RAM is not a permanent storage, so data would be lost after a reboot or power loss. 

Follow these steps to create a RAM disk:

1. Open a terminal.

2. Enter the following where `size` should be replaced by the size you want to allocate to your RAM disk:

```bash
mkdir /tmp/ramdisk
mount -t tmpfs -o size=512m tmpfs /tmp/ramdisk
```
In this example, a RAM disk of 512MB is created and is located at /tmp/ramdisk. 

3. Now, verify it with the df command:
```bash
df -h
```
This will list all the mounted file systems including our newly created RAM disk. You can find your newly made RAM disk with its size.

Remember to replace '512m' with the size that suits your needs. The reference for 'm' stands for Megabytes. It can also be 'g' for Gigabytes.

This RAM disk would be destroyed after reboot. If you want to create it automatically after every reboot, consider adding the mount command to the `/etc/fstab/`. However, be very careful while editing fstab because if you do it wrong, it may prevent your system from booting up.
