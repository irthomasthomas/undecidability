**Prompt:**
write a script to loop over every man page on the manjaro arch linux desktop and save a text version of the man using pandoc

**Response:**
Sure! Here's an example script in bash that can perform the task you described:

```bash
#!/bin/bash

# Define the output directory where the converted man pages will be saved
output_directory="/path/to/output/directory"

# Loop over each man page
for manfile in /usr/share/man/man*/*; do
  # Extract the man page name for saving
  man_name=$(basename "${manfile%.*}")

  # Convert the man page to text using pandoc
  pandoc -s -t plain "$manfile" -o "$output_directory/$man_name.txt"

  echo "Converted $manfile"
done

echo "Conversion complete!"
```

Before running the script, make sure to replace "/path/to/output/directory" with the desired directory where you want to save the converted man pages.

Note that this script assumes that the man pages are located under the "/usr/share/man" directory. If your setup differs, you may need to adjust the loop accordingly.

Additionally, ensure that you have pandoc installed on your Manjaro Arch Linux desktop. You can install it using the package manager, e.g., `sudo pacman -S pandoc`.

Make the script executable using `chmod +x scriptname.sh` and then run it by executing `./scriptname.sh`. The script will loop over every man page, convert it to plain text using pandoc, and save it in the specified output directory.
