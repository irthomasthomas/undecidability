**Prompt:**
write a script to loop over every man page on the manjaro arch linux desktop and save a text version of the man using pandoc

**Response:**
Here's a script that loops over every man page on a Manjaro Arch Linux desktop, converts them to a text version using Pandoc, and saves them:

```bash
#!/bin/bash

# Loop through each man page
for file in /usr/share/man/man*/*; do
    # Extract the man page name and section
    filename=$(basename "$file")
    manname="${filename%%.*}"
    section="${filename##*.}"

    # Create a directory to save the converted man pages if it doesn't exist
    save_directory="/path/to/save/directory"
    if [ ! -d "$save_directory" ]; then
        mkdir -p "$save_directory"
    fi

    # Convert the man page to text using Pandoc
    pandoc "$file" -s -t plain -o "$save_directory/$manname-$section.txt"
    echo "Converted $manname-$section.txt"
done
```

Replace `/path/to/save/directory` with the desired directory path where you want to save the converted man pages.

Make sure you have Pandoc installed on your system. If not, you can install it using the package manager.

Note: This script assumes that the man pages are located in the standard directory `/usr/share/man`. If they are located elsewhere on your system, modify the `for` loop accordingly.

Save the script to a file, e.g., `man_to_text_converter.sh`, and make it executable using `chmod +x man_to_text_converter.sh`. Then, simply run the script using `./man_to_text_converter.sh` to start converting and saving the man pages.
