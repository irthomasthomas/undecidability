**Prompt:**
write a script to loop over every man page on the manjaro arch linux desktop and save a text version of the man using pandoc

**Response:**
Here's an example bash script you could use:

```bash
#!/bin/bash

# Directory to put the text files
OUTPUT_DIR=~/manpages

# Creating the directory if it does not exist
mkdir -p $OUTPUT_DIR

# Get list of all man pages
manpages=$(man -k . | cut -d' ' -f1)

# Loop over all man pages
for manpage in $manpages
do
    # Check if manpage is available
    if man -w $manpage > /dev/null 2>&1; then
        # Create temporary HTML file
        man -Thtml $manpage > /tmp/temp.html

        # Convert HTML to text using pandoc
        pandoc -s -o $OUTPUT_DIR/$manpage.txt /tmp/temp.html

        # Remove temporary HTML file
        rm /tmp/temp.html

        echo "$manpage is done!"
    else
        echo "$manpage does not exist or is not installed."
    fi
done
```
This script will save each man page as a plain text file using pandoc in the specified directory.

Please make sure that pandoc is installed on the system and manpages are accessible.

This script assumes your pandoc can take HTML as input. If not, pandoc has to be upgraded.

Also, notice that, this script is not perfect. It's possible for it to attempt to convert any non-unique manpages with the same names which may replace the previously converted manpages.

You would want to run this script in a directory where you have permission too, and it might take a while to complete because it has to convert a lot of manpages.
