**Prompt:**
Write a script using zcat and pandoc -f man to convent every man page to text

**Response:**
Here is a bash script that converts every man page to text:

```bash
#!/bin/bash
dir="/usr/share/man" # Directory containing the man pages

for section in $(ls $dir); do # Iterate over all sections
  for manpage in $(ls $dir/$section); do # Iterate over all man pages of each section
    page="${manpage%.*}" # Remove the extension from the man page
    outfile="${section}_${page}.txt" # Define the output file name
    # Use zcat to extract the man page and pipe it to pandoc for conversion, then output to the outfile
    zcat $dir/$section/$manpage | pandoc -f man -t plain -o $outfile
  done
done

echo "Conversion of man pages to text files is complete."
```
This script converts all the man pages in the `/usr/share/man` directory which is the usual location of man pages in most Linux distributions. An output text file is created for each man page, named as `<section>_<manpage>.txt`.

Note:

Please ensure that you have sufficient permissions to read from the source directory and write to the destination directory.

You also need to have `zcat` and `pandoc` installed on your system to run this script. If you don't have them installed, you can typically install them using the package manager of your operating system. For example, on a Ubuntu system, you can install them using `apt`:

```
sudo apt-get install gzip
sudo apt-get install pandoc
```

You can save this script to a file, make it executable using `chmod +x scriptname.sh`, and then run it using `./scriptname.sh`.
