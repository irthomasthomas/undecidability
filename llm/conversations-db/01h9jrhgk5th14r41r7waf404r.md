  "Goal Oriented Userinterface",
  "A goal-oriented user interface is a user interface design approach that focuses on guiding users towards achieving their goals efficiently and effectively.\n\nThe main objective of a goal-oriented user interface is to minimize the cognitive load on users by providing clear and intuitive pathways to complete tasks and achieve specific goals. This is achieved by designing the interface with a deep understanding of user needs, tasks, and workflows.\n\nKey principles of a goal-oriented user interface include:\n\n1. Clear and intuitive navigation: The interface should have clear and easy-to-understand navigation elements that allow users to easily move between different sections and complete tasks effortlessly.\n\n2. Task-oriented design: The interface should be designed around the tasks and goals of the users, ensuring that the most important actions and information are prominently displayed and easily accessible.\n\n3. Minimal distractions: Unnecessary elements and distractions should be minimized to maintain focus on the task at hand. This includes removing clutter, avoiding unnecessary notifications, and providing a visually clean and uncluttered interface.\n\n4. Contextual guidance: The interface should provide contextual guidance and feedback to users, helping them understand their progress, next steps, and any errors or issues that may arise.\n\n5. Personalization: The interface should allow users to customize their experience based on their individual preferences and goals, enabling them to prioritize and access the most relevant information and actions.\n\n6. Efficient interactions: The interface should optimize interactions and workflows to minimize the number of steps and actions required to complete tasks, reducing user effort and increasing efficiency.\n\n7. User feedback and iteration: User feedback should be collected and analyzed to continuously improve the interface and address any pain points or areas of confusion.\n\nOverall, a goal-oriented user interface aims to provide users with a seamless and intuitive experience that helps them achieve their goals effectively and efficiently."

 great, heres the output. How do I access each entry individualy?

**Response:**
To access each entry individually, you can use an index to access the desired item in the list. Here's an example:

```
output = [
  "2023-09-03T10:34:18.465893",
  "01h9d9qgcb97rf0ddkfpz19bge",

# Accessing individual entries
entry1 = output[0]
entry2 = output[1]
# and so on...

print(entry1)
print(entry2)
# and so on...
```

Replace `output` with the variable containing your actual output list, and use the desired index number to access each entry individually.
