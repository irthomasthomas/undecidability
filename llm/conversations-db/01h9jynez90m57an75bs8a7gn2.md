**Prompt:**
What is the best terminal command, small function, or script to run in order to: add label to jq output?


**Response:**
One way to add a label to the output of `jq` is by using the `echo` command along with a pipe (`|`) to redirect the output of `jq` to it. Here's an example:

```bash
echo "Label: $(jq '<jq_filter>' <input_file>)"
```

Replace `<jq_filter>` with your desired `jq` filter and `<input_file>` with the path to your input file.

For example, if you have a JSON file called `data.json` with the following content:

```json
{
  "name": "John",
  "age": 30,
  "city": "New York"
}
```

And you want to add a label "Person" to the output of `jq .name`, you can use the following command:

```bash
echo "Person: $(jq .name data.json)"
```

This will output:

```
Person: "John"
```

You can modify the label and `jq` filter according to your specific needs.
