**Prompt:**
which llm parameters control repetition?

**Response:**
In natural language processing, the following parameters control repetition:

1. n: The number of previous conversations or turns to consider while generating a response. If the value of n is high, the model is more likely to generate repetitive responses.

2. Temperature: It controls the randomness of the model's output. Higher temperature values (e.g., 1.0) make the model more diverse and less repetitive, while lower values (e.g., 0.2) make the output more focused and potentially repetitive.

3. Top-k: It controls the number of highest probability tokens to consider for each step. Reducing the top-k value limits the model's options and can decrease repetition.

4. Top-p (also known as nucleus or "n-sampling"): It controls the cumulative probability mass used for each step. It only considers tokens whose cumulative probability mass exceeds the chosen threshold. Lower top-p values reduce repetition as they restrict the number of tokens considered.

By adjusting these parameters appropriately, you can influence the repetition behavior of LLM models.
