**Prompt:**
which parameters control repetition in transformer models like GPT3?

**Response:**
There are a few parameters that can control repetition in transformer models like GPT-3:

1. Temperature: The temperature parameter controls the randomness of the generated output. Higher values (e.g., 1.0) make the output more random, while lower values (e.g., 0.2) make it more deterministic. Higher temperatures can reduce repetition as the model explores more possibilities.

2. Top-k sampling: This parameter limits the number of tokens considered during sampling. Instead of considering all possible tokens, only the top-k tokens with the highest probabilities are considered. This can help avoid repetitive patterns by reducing the chances of selecting the same token repeatedly.

3. Top-p (nucleus) sampling: This parameter limits the cumulative probability distribution during sampling. Instead of considering all tokens with probabilities above a certain threshold, only the tokens with cumulative probabilities that exceed a dynamically determined threshold (based on the top-p value) are considered. This can also help avoid repetition by preventing the model from focusing on a small set of high-probability tokens.

4. Context window: The context window refers to the number of previous tokens the model considers when generating the next token. By adjusting the context window, you can control how much historical context the model uses, which can impact repetition. A larger context window may help reduce repetition by providing more context for the model to generate diverse responses.

It's important to note that while these parameters can help control repetition, they may also affect the coherence and quality of the generated output. Finding the right balance is crucial to achieve the desired results.
