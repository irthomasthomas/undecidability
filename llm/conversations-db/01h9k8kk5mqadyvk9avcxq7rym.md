**Prompt:**
which parameters control repetition in transformer models like GPT3?

**Response:**
There are a few parameters that can control repetition in transformer models like GPT-3:

1. Temperature: The temperature parameter controls the randomness of the generated output. Higher values (e.g., 1.0) make the output more random, while lower values (e.g., 0.2) make it more deterministic. Higher temperatures can reduce repetition as the model explores more diverse possibilities.

2. Top-k sampling: This parameter limits the number of tokens considered during sampling. Instead of considering all possible tokens, only the top-k most likely tokens are chosen. This can help reduce repetition by preventing the model from repeatedly selecting the same tokens.

3. Top-p (nucleus) sampling: This parameter limits the cumulative probability distribution during sampling. Instead of considering all tokens with a certain probability, only tokens with a cumulative probability that exceeds a certain threshold (e.g., 0.9) are considered. This can also help reduce repetition by preventing the model from repeatedly selecting the same tokens.

4. Context window size: The size of the context window can influence repetition. If the context window is too small, the model may not have enough information to generate diverse responses. Increasing the context window size can help reduce repetition by providing more context for the model to generate responses.

It's important to note that while these parameters can help control repetition, they may not completely eliminate it. Repetition can still occur due to the nature of the model and the training data.
