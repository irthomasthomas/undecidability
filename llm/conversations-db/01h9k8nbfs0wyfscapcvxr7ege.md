**Prompt:**
which parameters control repetition in transformer models like GPT3?

**Response:**
There are a few parameters that can control repetition in transformer models like GPT-3:

1. Temperature: The temperature parameter controls the randomness of the generated output. Higher values like 1.0 make the output more random, while lower values like 0.2 make it more deterministic.

2. Top-K Sampling: This parameter limits the vocabulary size by only considering the K most likely tokens at each generation step, filtering out less probable options.

3. Top-p (Nucleus) Sampling: This approach considers a specified probability threshold (p) and selects from only those tokens that collectively exceed this threshold probability. It dynamically adjusts the number of candidate tokens based on their probabilities.

4. Maximum Length Constraint: By setting a maximum length for generated outputs, repetition can be controlled as it limits how long model-generated sequences can be.

5. Beam Search: By using beam search instead of sampling, you explore multiple possible continuations for each sequence and choose optimal sequences based on scoring metrics like log-likelihood or token probabilities.

Using these parameters wisely helps in controlling repetition and improving diverse outputs from transformer models like GPT-3-based systems.
