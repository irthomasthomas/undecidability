**Prompt:**
which parameters control repetition in transformer models like GPT3?

**Response:**
There are two main parameters that control repetition in transformer models like GPT-3:

1. Temperature: The temperature parameter determines the randomness of the generated output. Higher temperatures (e.g., 1.0) make the model more creative and generate more diverse but potentially nonsensical responses. Lower temperatures (e.g., 0.2) make the model more deterministic, generating more focused and repetitive responses.

2. Top-k or Top-p (Nucleus) Sampling: These are techniques used to constrain the output probabilities based on a threshold. Top-k sampling sets a limit on the number of tokens to consider for each step, while nucleus or Top-p sampling considers progressively smaller sets of the highest probability tokens until a cumulative probability threshold is met. Both techniques help avoid overuse of repetitive words or phrases in generated text.

By adjusting these parameters, one can control how likely the model is to produce repetitive responses. However, achieving the perfect balance between coherence and novelty remains a challenging task.
