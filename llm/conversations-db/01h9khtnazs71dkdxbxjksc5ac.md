**Prompt:**
 | sort | uniq -c | sort -nr | head

**Response:**
This command sorts the input, removes duplicates, counts the occurrences of each unique line, sorts again in reverse numeric order, and finally displays only the top 10 lines with the highest count.

Here's an example of how this command would look in the terminal:

```
command | sort | uniq -c | sort -nr | head
```

For instance, if you have a file named "data.txt" with the following content:

```
apple
banana
apple
orange
banana
banana
orange
apple
```

Running the command `cat data.txt | sort | uniq -c | sort -nr | head` would produce the following output:

```
   3 apple
   3 banana
   2 orange
```

This output shows that "apple" and "banana" both appeared three times, while "orange" appeared two times.
