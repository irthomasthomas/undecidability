**Prompt:**
Explain which command limits it to top 10?: | sort | uniq -c | sort -nr | head

**Response:**
The command "sort" is used to sort the output in ascending order. 

The command "uniq -c" is used to count the number of occurrences of each unique line in the sorted output. The "-c" option is used to display the count next to each line.

The command "sort -nr" is used to sort the output in reverse (descending) order based on the count obtained from the previous command. The "-n" option specifies a numerical sorting and the "-r" option is used for reverse sorting.

The command "head" is used to display the first few lines of the input. By default, it displays the first 10 lines. So, combining "sort | uniq -c | sort -nr | head" limits the output to the top 10 lines with the highest count, as they will be displayed due to the "head" command.
