Explain 
Classification using embeddings

There are many ways to classify text. This notebook shares an example of text classification using embeddings. For many text classification tasks, we've seen fine-tuned models do better than embeddings. See an example of fine-tuned models for classification in Fine-tuned_classification.ipynb. We also recommend having more examples than embedding dimensions, which we don't quite achieve here.

**Response:**
Classification using embeddings refers to the process of categorizing or labeling text data by using embeddings, which are numerical representations of words or sentences. Embeddings capture the semantic meaning of text by representing words or sentences as dense vectors in a continuous space.

In this context, the notebook suggests that while fine-tuned models are generally more effective for text classification tasks, this example demonstrates the use of embeddings for classification. Fine-tuned models refer to pre-trained models that have been further trained on specific classification tasks.

The notebook also mentions that having more training examples than the number of embedding dimensions is recommended for better performance. This means that it is ideal to have a larger dataset for training the model than the dimensionality of the embeddings being used.
