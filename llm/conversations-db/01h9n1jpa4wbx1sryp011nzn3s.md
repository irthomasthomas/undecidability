**Prompt:**
#Markdown #Github #Mozilla \n\n how do you make text wrap in a code fence or code block in github issues comment?

**Response:**
To make text wrap in a code fence or code block in GitHub issues comment, you can use backticks (`) or triple backticks (```) to enclose your code.

For inline code, you can use single backticks surrounding the text. For example:

```
`code`
```

This will format the text as inline code and should wrap accordingly within the sentence.

To create a code block, you can use triple backticks (```) before and after the code. For example:

```
```
code block
```
```

This will create a separate code block where the text will wrap automatically.

You can also specify the programming language in the opening backticks to enable code syntax highlighting. For example:

```
```python
print("Hello, World!")
```
```

In this case, the code block will be highlighted as Python code, but the text will still wrap.

Keep in mind that sometimes the text wrapped within the code block can create a horizontal scrollbar, depending on the width of the container it is displayed in.

**Prompt:**
wrap long lines?

**Response:**
If you have long lines of code or text within a code block in GitHub issues comments and you want to wrap them to fit within the specified width, you can add line breaks manually at appropriate points.

For example:

```
```python
long_line_of_code_with_no_wrapping_long_line_of_code_with_no_wrapping_long_line_of_code_with_no_wrapping
```
```

You can modify the code block like this:

```
```python
long_line_of_code_with_no_wrapping_
long_line_of_code_with_no_wrapping_
long_line_of_code_with_no_wrapping
```
```

By adding the line breaks at the desired locations, the line will wrap within the code block.

However, please note that the automatic line wrapping is not supported in GitHub issues comments. You have to manually add the line breaks to achieve the desired wrapping effect.
