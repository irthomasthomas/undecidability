and history event?

**Response:**
To execute a specific command from your command history in zsh, you can use the `!` symbol followed by the event number. Here's an example:

```
!<event_number>
```

Replace `<event_number>` with the number of the event you want to execute. You can find the event number using the `history` command.

**Prompt:**
that executes the command without first telling me what it is

**Response:**
Apologies for the confusion. To view the command before executing it, you can use the `fc` command in zsh. Here's an example:

```
fc -e - <event_number>
```

Replace `<event_number>` with the number of the event you want to view and execute. This will open the command in an editor (default is usually `vi`) before executing it, allowing you to see and modify the command if needed.
