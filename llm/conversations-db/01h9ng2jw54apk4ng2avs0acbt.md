I want the function to run automatically when a new issue is created with the right label. It retrieve the body text of the issue, pass it to a function, and return the output as a new comment

**Response:**
Achieving this task involves interacting with GitHub API and probably setting up a GitHub Actions or Webhooks that could trigger the running of the function, here's a simple and basic way to get started using curl in Bash:

```bash
# set token and repo/owner info
TOKEN="" # Put your personal GitHub token here
OWNER="owner"
REPO="repo"
LABEL="label"

# retrieve issues with label
ISSUES=$(curl -s -H "Authorization: token $TOKEN" \
            -H "Accept: application/vnd.github+json" \
            "https://api.github.com/repos/$OWNER/$REPO/issues?labels=$LABEL&state=open")

# parse issues to retrieve the body text
BODIES=$(echo "$ISSUES" | jq -r '.[] | .body')

# pass each body text to a function and return the output as a new comment
for body in $BODIES; do
    OUTPUT=$(your_function $body) # replace `your_function` with your actual function
    DATA=$(jq -n --arg body "$OUTPUT" '{"body": $body}')

    # POST request to create a new comment
    curl -s -H "Authorization: token $TOKEN" \
        -H "Accept: application/vnd.github.v3+json" \
        -X POST -d "$DATA" \
        "https://api.github.com/repos/$OWNER/$REPO/issues/$number/comments"
done
```

In Bash, you can't directly pass the body text to a function. You might need to do it in Python or use a bash command instead of a function.

Be sure to replace `"owner"` and `"repo"` with your repo data and `"label"` with the label you want to retrieve. Also, you need to replace `your_function` with the command or the function you want to pass the body text.

Please note that this will only retrieve the issues that are already there. If you want the function to run automatically when a new issue is created with the right label, you should look into setting up a GitHub Action or a Webhook. This way every time a new issue is created (or any other trigger you set) the action is run, your script is executed, and the Github API is called to do whatever you need. You can even set it up to label the issue as completed when the script is finished.
