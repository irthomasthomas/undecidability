 In bash, receive instructions from a github repo issues. I want the function to run automatically when a new issue is created with the right label. It retrieve the body text of the issue, pass it to a function, and return the output as a new comment

Here are all of the gh cli tools available. If youwant the help page for one you can ask $(cat github-cli-commands-available-summary.md)" -m 4 Here is an example of how to achieve this using GitHub actions and gh cli. You could have a .github/workflows/main.yml file with this. It triggers a GitHub action when an issue with the label run is created, runs a shell script, and comments the output back to the issue.  ```yaml name: Run Script on:  issues:    types: [opened, labeled] jobs:  auto-reply:    runs-on: ubuntu-latest    steps:      - name: Checkout        uses: actions/checkout@v2      - name: Check Label        id: label_check        run: |          issue_number=$(jq --raw-output .issue.number "$GITHUB_EVENT_PATH")          current_label=$(jq --raw-output .label.name "$GITHUB_EVENT_PATH")          if [[ "$current_label" == "run" ]]; then            echo "::set-output name=run::true"            echo "::set-output name=issue_number::$issue_number"          else            echo "::set-output name=run::false"          fi      - name: Run Script        id: script        run: ./script.sh      - name: Comment        run: |            output="${{ steps.script.outputs.result }}"            issue_number="${{ steps.label_check.outputs.issue_number }}"            gh issue comment "$issue_number" --repo ${{ github.repository }} --body "$output"        if: steps.label_check.outputs.run == 'true'        env:          GH_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }} ``` This example assumes that you have a file called script.sh in your repository root directory that you want to run. This is a simplified example, the actual implementation would depend on what your script does and how you want to handle errors.  The authentication is managed by the secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN which is automatically made available to GitHub actions.  You also need to setup gh cli in the GitHub action. Here is the command to do that in a step: ```yaml - name: Setup GitHub CLI  uses: cli/setup-gh@v1 ```  You would then insert it into the job steps like this: ```yaml jobs:  auto-reply:    runs-on: ubuntu-latest    steps:      - name: Checkout        uses: actions/checkout@v2            - name: Setup GitHub CLI        uses: cli/setup-gh@v1      ... ``` This way, the gh command is available within the action and can be used to interact with the issues.

Thank you for the detailed example! Here are a few additional thoughts on your approach:

    To trigger on a specific label like "run", you can use github.event.label.name == 'run' instead of parsing the event payload.
    For better error handling, you may want to wrap the script.sh call in a try/catch block and handle failures gracefully.
    Consider using the actions/github-script action instead of gh cli. It allows calling the GitHub APIs directly without needing to install gh.
    To make the script idempotent and avoid duplicate comments, you can check for an existing comment by the bot before posting a new one.
    For security, best to minimize use of secrets like GITHUB_TOKEN and use scoped access tokens where possible.
    Adding some logging and output for diagnostics can help troubleshoot any issues.

Overall this is a great start! GitHub actions are very powerful for automating workflows like this triggered by various events. Let me know if you have any other questions!

Thanks. Also, I need to call an api which charges and needs an api key. Should I add my key somewhere, or should I route the request through my own computer?

Good question! When using sensitive keys like API keys in a GitHub Action workflow, it's best not to hardcode them directly in the workflow YAML file. Here are some more secure ways to handle API keys:

    Store the API key as a secret in the repository or organization secrets:

yaml

Copy code
- name: Call API 
  env:
    API_KEY: ${{ secrets.API_KEY }}

    Store the key in an Actions secret and pass it into the workflow:

yaml

Copy code
jobs:
  call-api:
    secrets: 
      api-key: ${{ secrets.API_KEY }}

    Use GitHub Environments to manage secrets for specific environments like staging vs production.
    For third party APIs, consider using a middleware server that you control to proxy the requests. Store keys securely on the server and have the Action call your server.
    For private repositories, you can create a PAT (Personal Access Token) and store it as a secret to call APIs on behalf of the workflow.

The key things to avoid are:

    Hardcoding API keys in workflow files
    Printing secrets in workflow logs
    Committing secrets into the repository

Proper secret management is important both for security and to avoid hitting API limits. Let me know if any part needs more clarification!

**Response:**
You're welcome! I'm glad you found my suggestions helpful. I do agree with you, especially when dealing with third-party APIs that are charged or rate-limited, it is best to add your API key securely and definitely not to hardcode them in your scripts or expose them to the public. 

Here are a few ways through which you can do this:

1. You could store your API key as a secret in your repository settings. GitHub secrets are encrypted and can be used in GitHub Actions workflows. You could then expose this secret as an environment variable and use this environment variable in your script.

Here is a sample usage:

```yaml
jobs:
  build:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
    - name: Use secret as an environment variable
      run: |
        curl -H "Authorization: Bearer ${API_KEY}" https://api.example.com
      env:
        API_KEY: ${{ secrets.API_KEY }}
```

In the above example, `${API_KEY}` inside the script will get substituted with the actual secret value stored in your repository.

2. Another way to call the API would be through your own server as a proxy. This could be more secure as your key would never leave your server and would also enable more control over the requests being sent to the third-party API.

Remember, whichever way you choose, always ensure that your secrets are kept safe and never exposed in logs, scripts, or other insecure locations.
