Note: Avoid payload parsing if poss. use actions/github-script instead of gh cli, if poss.In bash, receive instructions from a github repo issues. I want the function to run automatically when a new issue is created with the right label. It retrieve the body text of the issue, pass it to a function, and return the output as a new comment

Here are all of the gh cli tools available. If youwant the help page for one you can ask $(cat github-cli-commands-available-summary.md)" -m 4 Here is an example of how to achieve this using GitHub actions and gh cli. You could have a .github/workflows/main.yml file with this. It triggers a GitHub action when an issue with the label run is created, runs a shell script, and comments the output back to the issue.  ```yaml name: Run Script on:  issues:    types: [opened, labeled] jobs:  auto-reply:    runs-on: ubuntu-latest    steps:      - name: Checkout        uses: actions/checkout@v2      - name: Check Label        id: label_check        run: |          issue_number=$(jq --raw-output .issue.number "$GITHUB_EVENT_PATH")          current_label=$(jq --raw-output .label.name "$GITHUB_EVENT_PATH")          if [[ "$current_label" == "run" ]]; then            echo "::set-output name=run::true"            echo "::set-output name=issue_number::$issue_number"          else            echo "::set-output name=run::false"          fi      - name: Run Script        id: script        run: ./script.sh      - name: Comment        run: |            output="${{ steps.script.outputs.result }}"            issue_number="${{ steps.label_check.outputs.issue_number }}"            gh issue comment "$issue_number" --repo ${{ github.repository }} --body "$output"        if: steps.label_check.outputs.run == 'true'        env:          GH_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }} ``` This example assumes that you have a file called script.sh in your repository root directory that you want to run. This is a simplified example, the actual implementation would depend on what your script does and how you want to handle errors.  The authentication is managed by the secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN which is automatically made available to GitHub actions.  You also need to setup gh cli in the GitHub action. Here is the command to do that in a step: ```yaml - name: Setup GitHub CLI  uses: cli/setup-gh@v1 ```  You would then insert it into the job steps like this: ```yaml jobs:  auto-reply:    runs-on: ubuntu-latest    steps:      - name: Checkout        uses: actions/checkout@v2            - name: Setup GitHub CLI        uses: cli/setup-gh@v1      ... ``` This way, the gh command is available within the action and can be used to interact with the issues.

Thank you for the detailed example! Here are a few additional thoughts on your approach:

    To trigger on a specific label like "run", you can use github.event.label.name == 'run' instead of parsing the event payload.
    For better error handling, you may want to wrap the script.sh call in a try/catch block and handle failures gracefully.
    Consider using the actions/github-script action instead of gh cli. It allows calling the GitHub APIs directly without needing to install gh.
    To make the script idempotent and avoid duplicate comments, you can check for an existing comment by the bot before posting a new one.
    For security, best to minimize use of secrets like GITHUB_TOKEN and use scoped access tokens where possible.

**Response:**
That's right, using `github.event.label.name == 'run'` will indeed provide a more efficient way of triggering the action on a specific label. An `if` condition could be used in the `on.issues.types` section of the YAML file to check this before executing the script.

Implementing error handling is definitely a good idea. To do so, wrap the call to `script.sh` in a try/catch block. This way, if the script throws an exception, the catch block can handle it gracefully and optionally post a helpful comment back to the issue.

The `actions/github-script` action is a powerful GitHub provided action to directly call the GitHub APIs from a workflow file. This could simplify the process further and make it more reliable as it wouldn't need to setup and authenticate gh cli.

To avoid duplicate comments, before posting a new comment, a GET request can be made to the issue's comments endpoint to check if a comment by the bot already exists.

As for the best security practices, indeed restricting the use of the highly privileged `GITHUB_TOKEN` secret is advisable. Instead, prefer to use access tokens with scoped permissions where possible. These tokens can also be used for specific purposes, making misuse less likely. They can be added as secrets and used in the same way as GITHUB_TOKEN in the workflow file.

Ultimately, the precise implementation will depend on the details of your script and the requirements of your project.

**Prompt:**
Proceed with implementation

**Response:**
To proceed with the implementation, follow the steps below:

1. Create a file named `main.yml` in the `.github/workflows/` directory of your repository. The file name and location can be changed based on your preference. 

2. In that file, use the following modified code snippet based on the previous discussion:

```yaml
name: Run Script
on:
   issues:
    types: [opened, labeled]

jobs:
  auto-reply:
    if: github.event.label.name == 'run'
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

    steps:
      - name: Checkout
        uses: actions/checkout@v2
      
      - name: Setup GitHub CLI
        uses: cli/setup-gh@v1

      - name: Run Script
        id: script
        run: |
          try {
            output=$(./script.sh)
            echo "::set-output name=result::$output"
           } catch {
           echo "The script failed to run"
           output="An error has occurred while running the script."
           }

      - name: Post Comment
        id: comment
        uses: actions/github-script@v3.1.0
        with:
          github-token: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
          script: |
            const issue_number = context.issue.number;
            const comments = await github.issues.listComments({...context.repo, issue_number});
            const bot_comment_exists = comments.data.some(comment => comment.user.login === 'github-actions[bot]' && comment.body.includes('Your output text here'));
            if (!bot_comment_exists) {
              await github.issues.createComment({...context.repo, issue_number, body: '${{steps.script.outputs.result}}'});
            }
```

Here's what this script does:

1. It's triggered whenever an issue is labeled or created.
2. Checks if the label name equals 'run'.
3. If true, the workflow continues, otherwise, it stops.
4. The script at `./script.sh` is executed.
5. A list of comments on the issue is fetched.
6. It's checked if there exists a comment by the GitHub Actions bot that includes some specific content.
7. If such a comment doesn't exist already, a new comment is created which contains the output of your script.

Make sure to replace `Your output text here` with a string which is representative of the comments made by your action.

Also, please note that this is a simplified example. Exact implementation might depend on specific requirements like the content of the script to run, handling different types of errors, or parsing the output before posting it to GitHub issues.

Lastly, this script assumes that you have a script named `script.sh` at the root of your repository but you can change this to wherever your script resides.
