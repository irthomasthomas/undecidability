**Prompt:**
Just a very simple bash script that echos Hello, from Github Actions

**Response:**
Sure! Here's a simple bash script that echoes "Hello, from Github Actions":

```bash
#!/bin/bash

echo "Hello, from Github Actions"
```

You can save this script in a file, e.g., `hello.sh`. Then, you can run the script using the `bash` command or execute it directly if it has execute permissions.

Here's an example of running the script using the `bash` command:

```bash
bash hello.sh
```

After running the script, it will output:

```
Hello, from Github Actions
```

That's it! This script simply echoes the message "Hello, from Github Actions" using the `echo` command in bash.
