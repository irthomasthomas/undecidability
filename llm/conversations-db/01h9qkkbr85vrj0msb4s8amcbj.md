**Prompt:**
Write some keywords and nomenclature about the following unfinished note: Hello, I just came to say, well, I'm a bit of a slow poke, and I've struggled to let go of my old windows habits, despite being a full-time penguin for over five years. Using Nyxt, and reading the manual, my heart sank a bit when I saw the key-bindings. And the familiar frustrations began to set-in, what does C-o, a mean? And whats an M key? So a big C means Ctrl, and a big M means Alt. That's easy, right? For normal people, yes. But for someone with poor memory retrieval it's a big pain point. We can learn and remember even complex solutions, but we cannot reliably retrieve that information unprompted. It's like a box full of manila folders containing algorithms you diligently collected, and shipped with UPS to your new office, where it arrived with all its labels missing. The information is still there, but how do you find it? 

**Response:**
Keywords: slow poke, old windows habits, full-time penguin, Nyxt, key-bindings, frustrations, C-o, a, M key, Ctrl, Alt, poor memory retrieval, pain point, learn, remember, complex solutions, information, box, manila folders, algorithms, labels, find
