**Prompt:**
Shorten this: \n\nHello, I just came to say, well, I'm a bit of a slow poke, and I've struggled to let go of my old windows habits, despite being a full-time penguin for over five years. Using Nyxt, and reading the manual, my heart sank a bit when I saw the key-bindings. And the familiar frustrations began to set-in. "What does "C-o, a" mean? And whats an M key? So a big C means Ctrl, and a big M means Alt. That's easy, right? For normal people, yes. But for someone with poor memory retrieval it's a big pain point. We can learn and remember complex tasks, but we cannot reliably retrieve that information unprompted. 

Undeterred I copied the manual and asked claude2 for help. But while I was preparing (sort-of manual pre-processing) the key-bindings document, it dawned on me that simply find-replacing "C-" with "Ctrl+", and "M-" With "Alt+" dramatically improved my reading speed and comprehension of the manual. Then I realized that Nyxt, itself, contains the tools to do this for me automatically. In theory, I could set up some algorithm that automatically replaces key-bind notations in a web-page with those of my choosing. And I suppose you could go a step further with custom key-maps, so that if you are Dvorak user, and you changed hjkl for htns, then any page mentioning those would be rewritten automatically to reflect your custom key-map.

I'd like to work on that, but I have a lot of basic questions, first.
1. Can you recommend any videos showing it in use?
2. Can I disable command prediction?
3. Why are there tags and keywords, whats the different?
4. Can the tags or keywords be auto-assigned? 
5. Or can the prompt for tags and keywords be disabled? (Choice paralysis. It's a pain. I prefer generated-tags now.)
6. I'd like to use it like an IDE. With custom panels for a linux terminal, a chatgpt/claude conversation about the webpage. And an editor for making rules to change the webpage content, like the key-bind idea.
7. In the meantime, and to accelerate my learning, being able to pipe a page object to a shell script of mine would be cool. I want that to work like: On command, make a json object comprised of: url, title, domain, page_html, etc 

**Response:**
Hello, I'm a long-time Linux user but still struggling to let go of my Windows habits. I recently started using Nyxt and found the key-bindings confusing. I realized that replacing "C-" with "Ctrl+" and "M-" with "Alt+" improved my reading speed. I want to automate this process and potentially create custom key-maps. But before that, I have some basic questions:

1. Do you know any videos showing Nyxt in action?
2. Can I disable command prediction?
3. What's the difference between tags and keywords?
4. Can tags or keywords be assigned automatically?
5. Can I disable the prompt for tags and keywords?
6. I want to use Nyxt like an IDE with custom panels for a Linux terminal, chat conversations, and an editor for creating rules to change webpage content.
7. In the meantime, I would like to pipe a page object to a shell script for further processing, like creating a JSON object with URL, title, domain, and page HTML.

Thank you!
