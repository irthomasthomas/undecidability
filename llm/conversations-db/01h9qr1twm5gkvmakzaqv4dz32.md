Rewrite this github comment about the nyxt browser: \n\nHello, I just came to say, well, I'm a bit of a slow poke, and I've struggled to let go of my old windows habits, despite being a full-time penguin for over five years. Using Nyxt, and reading the manual, my heart sank a bit when I saw the key-bindings. And the familiar frustrations began to set-in. "What does "C-o, a" mean? And whats an M key? So a big C means Ctrl, and a big M means Alt. That's easy, right? For normal people, yes. But for someone with poor memory retrieval it's a big pain point. We can learn and remember complex tasks, but we cannot reliably retrieve that information unprompted. 

Undeterred I copied the manual and asked claude2 for help. But while I was preparing (sort-of manual pre-processing) the key-bindings document, it dawned on me that simply find-replacing "C-" with "Ctrl+", and "M-" With "Alt+" dramatically improved my reading speed and comprehension of the manual. Then I realized that Nyxt, itself, contains the tools to do this for me automatically. In theory, I could set up some algorithm that automatically replaces key-bind notations in a web-page with those of my choosing. And I suppose you could go a step further with custom key-maps, so that if you are Dvorak user, and you changed hjkl for htns, then any page mentioning those would be rewritten automatically to reflect your custom key-map.

I'd like to work on that, but I have a lot of basic questions, first.
1. Can you recommend any videos showing it in use?
2. Can I disable command prediction?
3. Why are there tags and keywords, whats the different?
4. Can the tags or keywords be auto-assigned? 
5. Or can the prompt for tags and keywords be disabled? (Choice paralysis. It's a pain. I prefer generated-tags now.)
6. I'd like to use it like an IDE. With custom panels for a linux terminal, a chatgpt/claude conversation about the webpage. And an editor for making rules to change the webpage content, like the key-bind idea.
7. In the meantime, and to accelerate my learning, being able to pipe a page object to a shell script of mine would be cool. I want that to work like: On command, make a json object comprised of: url, title, domain, page_html, etc 

**Response:**
Hello everyone, I just want to share my experience with Nyxt browser. As someone who has been using Linux for over five years, I found it difficult to let go of my old Windows habits. When I started using Nyxt and went through the manual, I felt a bit overwhelmed by the key-bindings. Understanding what "C-o, a" or an "M key" meant was a challenge for me. That's when I realized that a big C refers to Ctrl and a big M refers to Alt. While this may be easy for most people, it became a pain point for me due to my poor memory retrieval.

However, I didn't give up. I copied the manual and asked for help from claude2. As I was going through the key-bindings document, I had the idea to replace "C-" with "Ctrl+" and "M-" with "Alt+". This simple find and replace dramatically improved my reading speed and comprehension of the manual. It also struck me that Nyxt has the potential to automatically replace key-bind notations in web pages. It could even go further and allow users to customize their own key-maps to automatically rewrite pages mentioning specific keys.

I would like to work on this idea, but I have some basic questions first. 
1. Are there any recommended videos demonstrating Nyxt in use?
2. Is it possible to disable command prediction?
3. What is the difference between tags and keywords?
4. Can the tags or keywords be assigned automatically?
5. Alternatively, can the prompt for tags and keywords be disabled in favor of generated tags?
6. I envision using Nyxt like an IDE, with custom panels for a Linux terminal, a chatbot conversation, and an editor for creating rules to modify webpage content.
7. In the meantime, to enhance my learning, it would be great to be able to pipe a page object to one of my shell scripts. For example, being able to create a JSON object with the URL, title, domain, and page HTML.

Thank you in advance for any guidance you can provide.
