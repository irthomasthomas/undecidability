Rewrite this email about the nyxt browser: \n\nHello, I just came to say, well, I'm a bit of a slow poke, and I've struggled to let go of my old windows habits, despite being a full-time penguin for over five years. Using Nyxt, and reading the manual, my heart sank a bit when I saw the key-bindings. And the familiar frustrations began to set-in. "What does "C-o, a" mean? And whats an M key? So a big C means Ctrl, and a big M means Alt. That's easy, right? For normal people, yes. But for someone with poor memory retrieval it's a big pain point. We can learn and remember complex tasks, but we cannot reliably retrieve that information unprompted. 

Undeterred I copied the manual and asked claude2 for help. But while I was preparing (sort-of manual pre-processing) the key-bindings document, it dawned on me that simply find-replacing "C-" with "Ctrl+", and "M-" With "Alt+" dramatically improved my reading speed and comprehension of the manual. Then I realized that Nyxt, itself, contains the tools to do this for me automatically. In theory, I could set up some algorithm that automatically replaces key-bind notations in a web-page with those of my choosing. And I suppose you could go a step further with custom key-maps, so that if you are Dvorak user, and you changed hjkl for htns, then any page mentioning those would be rewritten automatically to reflect your custom key-map.

I'd like to work on that, but I have a lot of basic questions, first.
1. Can you recommend any videos showing it in use?
2. Can I disable command prediction?
3. Why are there tags and keywords, whats the different?
4. Can the tags or keywords be auto-assigned? 
5. Or can the prompt for tags and keywords be disabled? (Choice paralysis. It's a pain. I prefer generated-tags now.)
6. I'd like to use it like an IDE. With custom panels for a linux terminal, a chatgpt/claude conversation about the webpage. And an editor for making rules to change the webpage content, like the key-bind idea.
7. In the meantime, and to accelerate my learning, being able to pipe a page object to a shell script of mine would be cool. I want that to work like: On command, make a json object comprised of: url, title, domain, page_html, etc

Subject: Inquiry about Nyxt Browser

Hello,

I hope this email finds you well. I just wanted to reach out and share my experience with the Nyxt browser. As someone who has been using Linux for over five years now, I must admit that I've been slow to let go of my old Windows habits. However, upon using Nyxt and reading the manual, I encountered a few challenges.

One particular hurdle was understanding the key-bindings. Seeing terms like "C-o, a" and "M key" left me a bit confused. Eventually, I realized that the "C" indicates Ctrl and the "M" represents Alt. While this may be easy for most people, it becomes a pain point for individuals like me who struggle with memory retrieval.

Undeterred, I sought assistance from the manual and even asked claude2 for help. As I prepared the key-bindings document, it struck me that replacing "C-" with "Ctrl+" and "M-" with "Alt+" significantly improved my reading speed and comprehension. Interestingly, Nyxt itself has the tools to automate this process. I theorized that it's possible to set up an algorithm to automatically replace key-bind notations on web pages with my preferred alternatives. It could even go a step further by allowing custom key-maps for users who have modified their layouts, such as Dvorak.

Before diving into these possibilities, I have a few basic questions that I hope you can help me with:

1. Could you recommend any videos demonstrating Nyxt's usage?
2. Is it possible to disable command prediction?
3. What is the difference between tags and keywords?
4. Can tags or keywords be auto-assigned?
5. Can the prompt for tags and keywords be disabled to avoid choice paralysis? (Generated tags seem more appealing to me.)
6. I'd like to utilize Nyxt as an IDE, with custom panels for a Linux terminal, a chat conversation (such as chatgpt or claude), and an editor for creating rules to modify webpage content (similar to the key-bind idea).
7. In the meantime, to expedite my learning, it would be really cool if I could pipe a page object to one of my shell scripts. For instance, I'd like the ability to create a JSON object with details like the URL, title, domain, page HTML, etc., on command.

Thank you for taking the time to read through my email. I look forward to your guidance and support as I explore the possibilities with Nyxt.

Best regards,
[Your Name]
