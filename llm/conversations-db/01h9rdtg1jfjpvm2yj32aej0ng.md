**Prompt:**
Here I bash script that gets the sha for a file. Now I want this to be run from a github action. It should store the sha in a variable. Then if the sha is new, save the new sha to a file in my repo. Then copy the changed file from the monitored repo to my own. Think about the algorith carefully. It needs to be secure and robust. \n\n#!/bin/bash

# Define the repository owner, repository name, and file path
owner="dave1010"
repo="hubcap"
file_path="hubcap.php"
# echo "https://api.github.com/repos/$owner/$repo/commits?path=$file_path"
# Make a GET request to retrieve the latest commit information
response=$(curl -s "https://api.github.com/repos/$owner/$repo/commits?path=$file_path")

# Check if the request was successful
if [[ $(echo "$response" | jq -r "length") -gt 0 ]]; then
    latest_commit_sha=$(echo "$response" | jq -r ".[0].sha")

    # Compare the latest commit SHA with the previously stored SHA (you can store this in a file)
    # Perform necessary actions if the SHA has changed
    # For example, you can copy the file to your own repository or trigger a notification

    echo "The latest commit SHA for $file_path is: $latest_commit_sha"
else
    echo "Error retrieving commit information."
fi

**Response:**
To achieve your goal of running this script as a GitHub Action and performing the necessary actions based on the sha, you can create a workflow file in your repository. Here's how you can modify your bash script and create a workflow file:

1. Modify your bash script:
   - Remove the echo statements.
   - Add logic to compare the latest commit SHA with the previously stored SHA (stored in a file).
   - Perform actions if the SHA has changed, such as copying the file to your own repository or triggering a notification.
   - Save the latest commit SHA to the file for future comparisons.

Here's the modified script:

```bash
#!/bin/bash

# Define the repository owner, repository name, and file path
owner="dave1010"
repo="hubcap"
file_path="hubcap.php"
sha_file="latest_sha.txt" # File to store the latest commit SHA

# Read the previously stored SHA from the file
previous_sha=$(cat "$sha_file" 2>/dev/null)

# Make a GET request to retrieve the latest commit information
response=$(curl -s "https://api.github.com/repos/$owner/$repo/commits?path=$file_path")

# Check if the request was successful
if [[ $(echo "$response" | jq -r "length") -gt 0 ]]; then
    latest_commit_sha=$(echo "$response" | jq -r ".[0].sha")

    # Compare the latest commit SHA with the previously stored SHA
    if [[ "$latest_commit_sha" != "$previous_sha" ]]; then
        # Perform necessary actions if the SHA has changed
        # For example, copy the file to your own repository or trigger a notification

        # Copy the changed file from the monitored repository to your own repository
        cp "$file_path" "<your-destination-folder>"

        # Save the latest commit SHA to the file for future comparisons
        echo "$latest_commit_sha" > "$sha_file"

        echo "File copied successfully."
    else
        echo "No changes detected."
    fi
else
    echo "Error retrieving commit information."
fi
```

2. Create a workflow file:
   - In your repository, create a new folder called `.github/workflows`.
   - Inside that folder, create a file named `build.yaml` (or any name ending with `.yaml`).
   - Add the following content to the `build.yaml` file:

```yaml
name: Monitor and Copy File

on: [push] # Trigger the workflow when a push event occurs

jobs:
  build:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

    steps:
      - name: Check out code
        uses: actions/checkout@v2

      - name: Run bash script
        run: bash path/to/your/bash/script.sh
```

3. Modify the workflow file:
   - Replace `path/to/your/bash/script.sh` with the actual path to your bash script file.

That's it! The workflow will run whenever a push event occurs. It will check for changes in the monitored repository, copy the changed file to your own repository, and store the latest commit SHA for future comparisons.
