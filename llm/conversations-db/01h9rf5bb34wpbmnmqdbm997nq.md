**Prompt:**
The following bash script needs to be stored and run from the repo, is that ok? #!/bin/bash

# Define the repository owner, repository name, and file path
owner="dave1010"
repo="hubcap"
file_path="hubcap.php"
sha_file="latest_sha.txt" # File to store the latest commit SHA

# Define your own repository information
own_owner="irthomasthomas"
own_repo="undecidability"

# Intermediate local path to temporarily store the updated file
temp_file_path="/tmp/${file_path}"

# Read the previously stored SHA from the file
previous_sha=$(cat "$sha_file" 2>/dev/null)

# Make a GET request to retrieve the latest commit information
response=$(curl -s "https://api.github.com/repos/$owner/$repo/commits?path=$file_path")

# Check if the request was successful
if [[ $(echo "$response" | jq -r "length") -gt 0 ]]; then
    latest_commit_sha=$(echo "$response" | jq -r ".[0].sha")

  # Compare the latest commit SHA with the previously stored SHA
  if [[ "$latest_commit_sha" != "$previous_sha" ]]; then
     
    # Download the updated file
    curl -s "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/$owner/$repo/$latest_commit_sha/$file_path" -o "$temp_file_path"

     # Copy the downloaded file to your local workspace
    cp "$temp_file_path" "$file_path"

    # Commit and push the changes to your own repository
    git config --local user.email "action@github.com"
    git config --local user.name "GitHub Action"
    git add "$file_path"
    git commit -m "Update $file_path via GitHub Action"
    git push 

    # Save the latest commit SHA to the file for future comparisons
    echo "$latest_commit_sha" > "$sha_file"

    echo "File copied successfully."
  else
    echo "No changes detected."
  fi
else
  echo "Error retrieving commit information."
fi
```

For your workflow action, it should be updated to checkout your own repository:

```yaml
name: Monitor and Copy File

on: 
  schedule:
    - cron: '0 * * * *' # Trigger the workflow every hour

jobs:
  build:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

    steps:
      - name: Check out code
        uses: actions/checkout@v2
        with:
          repository: irthomasthomas/undecidability
          token: ${{ secrets.GH_TOKEN }} # Should be a newly generated GitHub token with repo scope

      - name: Run bash script
        run: bash path/to/your/bash/script.sh
```

**Response:**
Storing and running the bash script from the repository is fine. The script is used to monitor a file in a different repository (`dave1010/hubcap`), check for updates, and copy the updated file to your own repository (`irthomasthomas/undecidability`).

To set up the workflow action in your repository, you can use the provided YAML configuration. The workflow is triggered every hour and runs on Ubuntu.

Ensure that you update the `repository` field in the `actions/checkout@v2` step with your own repository information (`irthomasthomas/undecidability`). You should also generate a new GitHub token with repo scope and store it as a secret in your repository. Update the `token` field in the `actions/checkout@v2` step with the secret's name (e.g., `${{ secrets.GH_TOKEN }}`).

Once you have updated the YAML configuration, you can save it in your repository and the workflow action will be triggered according to the schedule defined.

**Prompt:**
If script.sh is in my repos /scripts dir how should the run command look?

**Response:**
If the `script.sh` file is in your repository's `/scripts` directory, you need to provide the correct relative path to the script in the `run` command. Here's how the `run` command should look:

```yaml
    - name: Run bash script
        run: bash scripts/script.sh
```

Ensure that the path specified in the `run` command matches the path where the `script.sh` file is located in your repository. Replace `scripts` in the example above with the correct directory name if it differs in your repository.
