**Prompt:**
cron to run once a minute


**Response:**
To schedule a cron job to run once a minute, you can use the asterisk (*) character in the minute field of the cron schedule. Here's an example:

```shell
* * * * * command_to_run_once_per_minute
```

The asterisk (*) in the minute field indicates that the cron job should run every minute. Replace "command_to_run_once_per_minute" with the actual command or script you want to run.

To set up the cron job, follow these steps:

1. Open a terminal or SSH into the server.
2. Use the crontab command to edit the cron schedule for the current user:
   ```
   crontab -e
   ```
3. In the text editor, add the above cron schedule line at the end of the file.
4. Save the file and exit the editor.
5. Cron will automatically pick up the changes and start running the specified command once per minute. You can check the logs or output of the command to verify that it's running as expected.
