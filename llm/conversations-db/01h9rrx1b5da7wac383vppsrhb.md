**Prompt:**
Do I need to change this so it can write file in the repo dir? \n\nname: Monitor and Copy File

on: 
  schedule:
    - cron: '* * * * *' # Trigger the workflow every hour

jobs:
  build:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

    steps:
      - name: Check out code
        uses: actions/checkout@v2
        with:
          repository: irthomasthomas/undecidability
          repo-token: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }} # Should be a newly generated GitHub token with repo scope

      - name: Run bash script
        run: bash ${GITHUB_WORKSPACE}/github-actions/sync_changed_file.sh

**Response:**
No, you do not need to change the code in order to write a file in the repository directory. The `${GITHUB_WORKSPACE}` environment variable already points to the current working directory of your repository. So, the file will be written in the repository directory by default.

However, please note that writing files directly to the repository directory is generally not recommended, as it can lead to conflicts and make it difficult to manage your codebase. It is better to write outputs or generated files to separate directories within your repository.

**Prompt:**
In my script, the hubcap.php file is saved to /tmp, but the cp does not work \n\n#!/bin/bash

# Define the repository owner, repository name, and file path
owner="dave1010"
repo="hubcap"
file_path="hubcap.php"
sha_file="latest_sha.txt" # File to store the latest commit SHA

# Define your own repository information
own_owner="irthomasthomas"
own_repo="undecidability"
echo "Running Synch Changed Files"
# Intermediate local path to temporarily store the updated file
temp_file_path="/tmp/${file_path}"

# Read the previously stored SHA from the file
previous_sha=$(cat "$sha_file" 2>/dev/null)
echo "previous_sha: $previous_sha"
# Make a GET request to retrieve the latest commit information
response=$(curl -s "https://api.github.com/repos/$owner/$repo/commits?path=$file_path")

# Check if the request was successful
if [[ $(echo "$response" | jq -r "length") -gt 0 ]]; then
    latest_commit_sha=$(echo "$response" | jq -r ".[0].sha")

  # Compare the latest commit SHA with the previously stored SHA
  if [[ "$latest_commit_sha" != "$previous_sha" ]]; then
    echo "shas are different!"

    # Download the updated file
    curl -s "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/$owner/$repo/$latest_commit_sha/$file_path" -o "$temp_file_path"
    echo "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/$owner/$repo/$latest_commit_sha/$file_path $temp_file_path"
    echo "$PWD"
    echo "$file_path"
     # Copy the downloaded file to your local workspace
    cp "$temp_file_path" "$file_path

    # Commit and push the changes to your own repository
    git config --local user.email "action@github.com"
    git config --local user.name "GitHub Action"
    git add "$file_path"
    git commit -m "Update $file_path via GitHub Action"
    git push

    # Save the latest commit SHA to the file for future comparisons
    echo "$latest_commit_sha" > "$sha_file"

    echo "File copied successfully."
  else
    echo "No changes detected."
  fi
else
  echo "Error retrieving commit information."
fi

**Response:**
The issue seems to be with the `cp` command in your script. You are missing the closing quotation mark for the destination file path. The line:
```
cp "$temp_file_path" "$file_path
```
should be corrected to:
```
cp "$temp_file_path" "$file_path"
```
Additionally, make sure that the script has the necessary permissions to write to the destination file path.
