**Response:**
The cp command may not work if the file or directory does not exist or if the destination does not have the correct permissions to write the file.

The following are some suggestions to identify the problem:

1. Add more debugging outputs: 

You've done a good job with echoing some information in your script. However, I would suggest also echoing the presence of both source and destination directories using the code below:
   
   ```bash
   echo "Source: $temp_file_path"
   [[ -f "$temp_file_path" ]] && echo "File exists" || echo "File does not exist"

   echo "Destination: $file_path"
   [[ -d $(dirname "$file_path") ]] && echo "Folder exists" || echo "Folder does not exist"
   ```
   
2. Check permissions:

Ensure the script and the user running the script have the correct permissions to access and write to the $file_path directory. Run `ls -l` to print the permissions of files and directories.

3. File paths: 

If you potentially use relative file paths in variable file_path, consider using absolute file paths to prevent issues relating to the current working directory.

4. Error messages: 

It is also a good idea to catch and display error messages while copying. Replace your cp line with the following:

    ```bash
    cp "$temp_file_path" "$file_path" || { echo "cp command failed"; exit 1; }
    ```

This will output "cp command failed" and stop script execution if the cp command fails. It should give you an indication of what the more specific problem is, such as "file not found" or "permission denied".

5. GitHub environment: 

Take note that GitHub Actions runs the scripts in a secure environment and may have limitations or additional requirements. Visit https://docs.github.com/en/github/automating-your-workflow-with-github-actions/using-environment-variables for more information.
