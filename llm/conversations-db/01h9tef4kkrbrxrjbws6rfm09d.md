**Prompt:**
Write a command to search all my paths for a time file and print the path

**Response:**
To search all of your paths for a file named "time" and print the path, you can use the `find` command. Here's the command you can run in your terminal:

```
find / -name time 2>/dev/null
```

This command will search the entire file system (`/`) for a file named "time" and print the path(s) where it is found. The `2>/dev/null` portion is used to redirect any error messages to /dev/null to avoid cluttering the output.

**Prompt:**
Restrict it to $PATH

**Response:**
To search only within your `$PATH` variable for a file named "time" and print the path, you can use the `which` command along with a loop. Here's the command you can run in your terminal:

```bash
IFS=":"; for dir in $PATH; do find $dir -name "time" 2>/dev/null; done
```

This command will iterate through each directory in your `$PATH` variable, using the `find` command to search for the file named "time" within each directory. The `2>/dev/null` part is used to redirect any error messages to `/dev/null` to avoid cluttering the output.
