**Prompt:**
Please expand this bash function which times commands so that it also records the command that was run

**Response:**
Here's an expanded version of the bash function that times commands and records the command that was run:

```bash
time_and_record() {
    # Function that times commands and records the command that was run

    # Check if command argument is provided
    if [ -z "$1" ]; then
        echo "No command provided"
        return 1
    fi
    
    # Get the command from arguments
    command="$@"
    
    # Record the command that was run
    echo "Command: $command" >> command_log.txt
    
    # Run the command and time it
    {
        start=$(date +%s.%N)
        eval "$command"
        end=$(date +%s.%N)
    } 2>> command_log.txt
    
    # Calculate the execution time
    execution_time=$(echo "$end - $start" | bc)
    
    # Record the execution time
    {
        echo "Execution Time: $execution_time seconds"
        echo "-------------------------------------"
    } >> command_log.txt
}
```

In this expanded version, a file named "command_log.txt" is used to store the command and the execution time. The `echo "Command: $command"` line records the command that was run, while the `echo "Execution Time: $execution_time seconds"` line records the execution time. Each recorded entry is separated by the "-------------------------------------" line in the log file.

To use the function, simply call `time_and_record` followed by the command you want to time. For example:

```bash
time_and_record ls -l
```

This will time the "ls -l" command and record it in the "command_log.txt" file.

Note: This function assumes that the `bc` command is available in your system to perform the calculation. If not, you can modify the function to use other methods to calculate the execution time.
