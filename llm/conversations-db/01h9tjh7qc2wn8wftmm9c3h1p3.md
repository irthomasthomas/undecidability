**Prompt:**
What is the best terminal command, small function, or script to run in order to: echo a value to a file as well as printing it in the terminal?


**Response:**
To echo a value to a file and print it in the terminal, you can use the following command:

```bash
echo "value" | tee file.txt
```

Replace "value" with the desired value you want to echo, and "file.txt" with the name of the file you want to write the value to.

The `tee` command is used to read from standard input and write to both standard output and files. In this case, it will write the value to the specified file and also print it in the terminal.
