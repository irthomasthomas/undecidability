**Prompt:**
What change should I make so that this script also prints the total time to the users terminal?\n\n timer() {
    # Function that times commands and records the command that was run

    # Check if command argument is provided
    if [ -z "$1" ]; then
        echo "No command provided" >&2
        return 1
    fi

    # Get the command from arguments
    cmd="$@"

    # Record the command that was run
    echo "Command: $cmd" >> $HOME/command_log.txt

    # Run the command and time it
    {
        start=$(date +%s)
        $cmd
        end=$(date +%s)
    } 2>> $HOME/command_log.txt

    # Calculate the execution time
    execution_time=$((end-start))

    # Record the execution time
    {
        echo "Execution Time: $execution_time seconds"
        echo "-------------------------------------"
    } >> $HOME/command_log.txt
}

**Response:**
You need to add a line of code at the end of the function to print the execution time to the user's terminal. 

```bash
echo "Total Time: $execution_time seconds"
```

So now, your function should look like this:

```bash
timer() {
    # Function that times commands and records the command that was run

    # Check if command argument is provided
    if [ -z "$1" ]; then
        echo "No command provided" >&2
        return 1
    fi

    # Get the command from arguments
    cmd="$@"

    # Record the command that was run
    echo "Command: $cmd" >> $HOME/command_log.txt

    # Run the command and time it
    {
        start=$(date +%s)
        $cmd
        end=$(date +%s)
    } 2>> $HOME/command_log.txt

    # Calculate the execution time
    execution_time=$((end-start))

    # Record the execution time
    {
        echo "Execution Time: $execution_time seconds"
        echo "-------------------------------------"
    } >> $HOME/command_log.txt
    
    # Print the total time
    echo "Total Time: $execution_time seconds"
}
```

With this addition, the function will print out the same total time of execution to the console that it saves to `command_log.txt`.
