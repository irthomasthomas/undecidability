**Prompt:**
What change should I make so that this script also prints the total time to the users terminal?\n\n timer() {
    # Function that times commands and records the command that was run

    # Check if command argument is provided
    if [ -z "$1" ]; then
        echo "No command provided" >&2
        return 1
    fi

    # Get the command from arguments
    cmd="$@"

    # Record the command that was run
    echo "Command: $cmd" >> $HOME/command_log.txt

    # Run the command and time it
    {
        start=$(date +%s)
        $cmd
        end=$(date +%s)
    } 2>> $HOME/command_log.txt

    # Calculate the execution time
    execution_time=$((end-start))

    # Record the execution time
    {
        echo "Execution Time: $execution_time seconds"
        echo "-------------------------------------"
    } >> $HOME/command_log.txt
}

**Response:**
The current script already calculates and prints the execution_time into a log file (command_log.txt). 
To print the total time to the user's terminal as well, edit the portion of script that calculates and records execution time as follows:

```bash
    # Calculate the execution time
    execution_time=$((end-start))

    # Record the execution time
    {
        echo "Execution Time: $execution_time seconds"
        echo "-------------------------------------"
    } >> $HOME/command_log.txt

    # Print the execution time
    echo "Total Execution Time: $execution_time seconds"
```

The `echo "Total Execution Time: $execution_time seconds"` line added to the bottom prints the total execution time in seconds to the terminal.

**Prompt:**
timer llm logs list -q "Experiment User msg" --json | jq '[.[] | {id, prompt, system, options_json, response_json, conversation_id, duration_ms, datetime_utc, conversation_name}]'
parse error: Invalid numeric literal at line 1, column 6

**Response:**
The error message "parse error: Invalid numeric literal at line 1, column 6" you're seeing is coming from `jq`, a lightweight and flexible command-line JSON processor. 

This error occurs when `jq` is given invalid JSON. Specifically, "Invalid numeric literal" suggests that `jq` is trying to read a number but encountering non-numeric characters. 

Without having the content of your JSON, it is hard to debug the specific issue. A common cause for this error is trying to parse an empty file or a file that isn't valid JSON.

To debug this issue:

- Make sure the command `llm logs list -q "Experiment User msg" --json` is producing a valid JSON output.

- Use a JSON validator to verify that the JSON being produced is valid.

- If the source data is not in your control, add some data checking before you parse it with `jq`.

- Consider different invocation options for `jq`, like `jq -R` or `jq -r`, to handle raw inputs.
