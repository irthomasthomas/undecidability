It appears that there is a syntax error in the code you provided. The error is in the line where you are trying to execute a command using the `timer` function. It seems that the command you are trying to run is not properly formatted within the function.

Please double-check the command you are passing to the `timer` function and make sure it is correct. Additionally, ensure that the code provided after the `timer` function definition is properly formatted.
