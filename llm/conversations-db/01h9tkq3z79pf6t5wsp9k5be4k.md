**Prompt:**
When I run the command without timer if works fine. What is up with this function? Heres a command I run timer llm logs list -q "Experiment User msg" --json | jq '[.[] | {id, prompt, system, options_json, response_json, conversation_id, duration_ms, datetime_utc, conversation_name}]'
parse error: Invalid numeric literal at line 1, column 6\n\n The timer function: \n\n timer() {
    # Function that times commands and records the command that was run

    # Check if command argument is provided
    if [ -z "$1" ]; then
        echo "No command provided" >&2
        return 1
    fi

    # Get the command from arguments
    cmd="$@"

    # Record the command that was run
    echo "Command: $cmd" >> $HOME/command_log.txt

    # Run the command and time it
    {
        start=$(date +%s)
        eval "$cmd"
        end=$(date +%s)
    } 2>> $HOME/command_log.txt

    # Calculate the execution time
    execution_time="$((end-start))"

    # Record the execution time
    {
        echo "Execution Time: $execution_time seconds"
        echo "-------------------------------------"
    } >> $HOME/command_log.txt
    echo "Total Execution Time: $execution_time seconds"
}

**Response:**
The timer function itself seems fine, but it can behave improperly when it is asked to time a command that contains special characters, pipes (`|`), redirects (`>`, `>>`), or other shell functionality. That's because special characters and certain syntax are processed by the shell before the command is passed to `eval`.

In your command, you are using the pipe character (`|`). This character tells the shell to create a pipeline between two commands. The problem is that the shell does this before your timer function calls `eval`, so `eval` sees the function as two separate commands.

If you want to time a command like this you should quote the entire command like this:

```
timer "llm logs list -q \"Experiment User msg\" --json | jq '[.[] | {id, prompt, system, options_json, response_json, conversation_id, duration_ms, datetime_utc, conversation_name}]'"
```

Notice that you not only need to surround the entire command with double quotes, but also escape the inner quotes with a backslash (`\`). This will make sure your command is processed as a single command by `eval`, and it will also preserve the behavior of the `|` and inner quotes.
