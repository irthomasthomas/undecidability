**Prompt:**
I have a python app installed with pipx called MyPyApp. I have also cloned the MyPyApp github repo with the source code. I want to add some print statements to the code to help me debug it. But then how do I install my moddified version?

**Response:**
To install your modified version of MyPyApp, you have two options:

Option 1: Use pipx to install the local clone

1. Open a terminal and navigate to the cloned MyPyApp directory:
   ```
   cd /path/to/MyPyApp
   ```

2. Activate the virtual environment of your MyPyApp installation:
   ```
   pipx run MyPyApp
   ```

3. Edit the source code files and add the necessary print statements.

4. Once you have made the modifications, you can either reinstall the package or use `pipx inject` to update the installed package:
   - Reinstall the package using:
     ```
     pipx uninstall MyPyApp
     pipx install .
     ```
   - Alternatively, use `pipx inject` to update the installed package:
     ```
     pipx inject MyPyApp .
     ```

Option 2: Directly install your modified version

1. Open a terminal and navigate to the cloned MyPyApp directory:
   ```
   cd /path/to/MyPyApp
   ```

2. Activate the virtual environment of your MyPyApp installation:
   ```
   pipx run MyPyApp
   ```

3. Edit the source code files and add the necessary print statements.

4. Once you have made the modifications, build and install the package directly:
   ```
   python setup.py install
   ```

Both options will install your modified version of MyPyApp. Now, you can simply run MyPyApp as usual, and it will execute your modified code.
