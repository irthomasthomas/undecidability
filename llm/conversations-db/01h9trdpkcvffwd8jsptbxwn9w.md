**Prompt:**
I have a python app installed with pipx called MyPyApp. I have also cloned the MyPyApp github repo with the source code. I want to add some print statements to the code to help me debug it. But then how do I install my moddified version?

**Response:**
Firstly, you need to make sure that you're in your cloned repo directory:

`cd path_to_your_cloned_MyPyApp_directory`

Then uninstall the pipx version of MyPyApp:

`pipx uninstall MyPyApp`

After adding your print statements or any modifications you wanted to do on the source code, you can install your modified version of the app with pipx via:

`pipx install .`

Or if you want to just link the current changes (you can modify the app and the changes will be visible without the need to reinstall the app each time) with:

`pipx install --editable .`

This will allow your currently cloned source code to be noticed by pipx. And any changes that you would make inside your cloned source code would reflect real-time on the installed app.

The `--editable` flag installs things in-place, where pipx links to your current app directory directly, instead of copying files to pipx's location. 

Please make sure you have activated your virtual environment before you proceed with these steps.
