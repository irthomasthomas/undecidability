**Prompt:**
I have a python app installed with pipx called MyPyApp. I have also cloned the MyPyApp github repo with the source code. I want to add some print statements to the code to help me debug it. But then how do I install my moddified version?

**Response:**
You can install your modified version of MyPyApp using pip in local development mode. From the root directory of your cloned repo, you can run the command:

```
pip install -e .
```

The `-e` flag installs the package in editable mode. When you modify the source code of the package, the installed package is also updated. Note that you might want to create and activate a Python virtual environment before you install the package, to isolate your local package environment from other packages installed on your system. You can create a virtual environment using `venv`:

```console
python3 -m venv path_to_new_virtualenv
```

Then, activate the virtual environment:

On Windows:

```console
path_to_new_virtualenv\Scripts\activate
```

On Unix or MacOS:

```console
source path_to_new_virtualenv/bin/activate
```

Remember to deactivate the virtual environment when you're done:

```console
deactivate
```
