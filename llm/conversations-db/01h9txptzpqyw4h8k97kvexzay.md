**Prompt:**
Now how do I open the file for editing at the line found? Using neovim or vim or whatever you suggest? \n\n ‚ùØ grep -n "Kagi_enrich" $funcs

**Response:**
To open a file for editing at a specific line using Neovim or Vim, you can use the following command:

For Neovim:
```bash
nvim +<line_number> <file_path>
```

For Vim:
```bash
vim +<line_number> <file_path>
```

In your case, if you want to open the file `$funcs` and go to line 73, you can use either of the following commands:

For Neovim:
```bash
nvim +73 $funcs
```

For Vim:
```bash
vim +73 $funcs
```

Replace `<line_number>` with the desired line number and `<file_path>` with the path to the file you want to edit.
