The 5 best Github Issues hacks of 2021 

**Response:**
1. Keyboard Shortcuts: Github has a wide range of keyboard shortcuts that can help you navigate and manage issues more efficiently. Some useful ones include pressing "l" to add labels, "c" to create a new issue, and "e" to edit an issue.

2. Task Lists: Github supports task lists within an issue, allowing you to track progress and completion of specific tasks. To create a task list, simply use "- [ ]" for an unchecked task and "- [x]" for a checked task. You can also see a progress bar showing the completion status of the tasks.

3. Mentions and Notifications: When working on an issue, you can mention specific team members or collaborators using "@username". This will notify them and help keep them in the loop. You can also subscribe to receive notifications for specific issues by clicking the "Subscribe" button.

4. Issue Templates: Github allows you to create issue templates to standardize the information and structure of new issues. This is particularly useful for open-source projects or team collaborations, as it ensures all necessary details are captured for each issue and makes it easier for contributors to provide relevant information.

5. Quick Actions: Github has a feature called Quick Actions, which lets you perform various actions directly through comment or issue descriptions. For example, you can reference other issues or pull requests using "#issueNumber" or "@username". You can also add labels, assignees, or milestone using special keywords like "/label", "/assign", or "/milestone".

Overall, these hacks can significantly enhance your workflow and productivity when working with Github issues in 2021.

5 secret Github Markdown tricks of 2021 

**Response:**
1. Tables: Github Markdown now supports tables, allowing you to create organized and structured content. To create a table, you can use pipes "|" to separate columns and dashes "-" to define the table header. For example:

```
| Column 1 | Column 2 |
|----------|----------|
| Data 1   | Data 2   |
```

2. Strikethrough: You can now add strikethrough text in Github Markdown. Simply wrap the text with two tildes (~). For example, `~~strikethrough~~` will appear as strikethrough.

3. Footnotes: Github Markdown now supports footnotes, allowing you to add extra information or references. To create a footnote, you can use square brackets followed by a caret and a number. For example:

```
This is a footnote[^1].

[^1]: This is the footnote content.
```

4. Automatic URL linking: Github Markdown will automatically convert URLs into clickable links. You don't need to enclose the link in any special syntax. Just paste the URL, and it will be automatically recognized as a hyperlink.

5. Task Lists in Comments: Task lists, which were previously only available in issues, can now be used in comments as well. This allows you to manage and track action items within comment threads. Similar to task lists in issues, use "- [ ]" for unchecked tasks and "- [x]" for checked tasks.

These secret Github Markdown tricks can help you add more functionality, formatting options, and organization to your documentation and communication on the platform.
