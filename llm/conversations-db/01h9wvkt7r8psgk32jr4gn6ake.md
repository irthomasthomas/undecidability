**Prompt:**
In programming ternery means

**Response:**
The term "ternary" in programming refers to the ternary operator, also known as the conditional operator. It is a shorthand way of writing an if-else statement. The ternary operator takes three operands: a condition, a value to be returned if the condition is true, and a value to be returned if the condition is false. It is represented by the ? and : symbols. 

The syntax of the ternary operator is as follows:

condition ? value_if_true : value_if_false

For example, the following statement checks if a variable "num" is greater than 10 and assigns a value based on the result:

int result = (num > 10) ? 20 : 30;

If the condition "num > 10" is true, the value 20 will be assigned to the variable "result". Otherwise, the value 30 will be assigned.
