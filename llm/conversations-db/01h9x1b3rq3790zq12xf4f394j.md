**Prompt:**
Language models like GPT3 use frequency of tokens in training data to predict forward tokens. This creates a bias toward old information and makes summarization of new material such as published research difficult, 

**Response:**
as the model is not explicitly aware of the timelines of the data it was trained on. Since GPT-3 is trained on a large corpus of diverse texts from the internet, it naturally becomes biased towards the frequency and distribution of tokens in that training data.

When it comes to summarizing new material or published research, GPT-3 might struggle due to its bias towards older information. As the model has learned from a vast amount of existing text, it tends to give more weight to commonly mentioned facts, ideas, and patterns that it has encountered before. It may not be able to selectively prioritize the most recent or important information, potentially leading to less accurate summaries.

Researchers are exploring methods to address this issue by fine-tuning models on specific domains or using supervised learning with more recent data. These approaches aim to mitigate the bias towards older information and enable language models to summarize new material more effectively.
