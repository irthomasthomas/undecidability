**Prompt:**
Language models like GPT3 use frequency of tokens in training data to predict forward tokens. This creates a bias toward old information and makes summarization of new material such as published research difficult. As of 2021, we have tested methods of summarization with GPT3 and ChatGPT3.5 and found the best 

**Response:**
method involves a two-step process. 

First, we fine-tune the language model using domain-specific data, such as published research articles. This helps the model become more knowledgeable about the specific subject matter and ensures that it is up to date with the latest information.

Second, we employ a combination of extractive and abstractive summarization techniques. Extractive summarization involves selecting the most important sentences or phrases directly from the text, while abstractive summarization involves generating new sentences that capture the main points. By combining these two approaches, we achieve a more accurate and concise summary of the new material.

However, it's worth noting that even with these strategies, there may still be limitations in summarizing new research as language models like GPT3 are not designed explicitly for summarization tasks. Ongoing research and advancements in natural language processing will hopefully address these challenges and offer even better approaches in the future.
