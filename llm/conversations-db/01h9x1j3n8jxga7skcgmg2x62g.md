**Prompt:**
Language models like GPT3 use frequency of tokens in training data to predict forward tokens. This creates a bias toward old information and makes summarization of new material such as published research difficult. As of 2021, we have tested methods of summarization with GPT3 and ChatGPT3.5 and found that for openAIs chatgpt, the following prompts had the most success,

**Response:**
resulting in concise and accurate summaries:

1. "Summarize the key findings of this research paper/article."
2. "Provide a brief overview of the main points discussed in this article/report."
3. "In a few sentences, summarize the main implications of this study."

Additionally, using prompts that specifically request summaries of recent research or the latest advancements in a particular field can help mitigate the bias towards old information. For example:

4. "Summarize the most notable and current trends in [your specific field of interest]."
5. "Provide a succinct summary of the latest breakthroughs in [relevant research area]."

These prompts encourage the language model to prioritize new and relevant information, resulting in more accurate and up-to-date summaries. However, it's important to note that even with these prompts, language models like GPT3 and ChatGPT3.5 may still exhibit some bias towards older information. Continuous testing and improvements are necessary to enhance their ability to summarize new material effectively.
