**Prompt:**
What is the best terminal command, small function, or script to run in order to: "xmodmap -e "keycode 66 ... Is it possible to set this to a super modifier, i.e. super + Ctrl + Alt + Shift??


**Response:**
To set the keycode 66 as a super modifier with Ctrl, Alt, and Shift, you can use the following xmodmap command:

```bash
xmodmap -e "keycode 66 = Super_L"
xmodmap -e "add mod4 = Super_L"
xmodmap -e "add Control = Super_L"
xmodmap -e "add Mod1 = Super_L"
xmodmap -e "add Shift = Super_L"
```

This command remaps the keycode 66 to the Super_L key and adds it as a modifier key for Super, Control, Alt, and Shift.
