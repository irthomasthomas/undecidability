 \n\n This a small project of mine, just two files, Pomedoro.sh, and screen_recorder.sh. As you can see there are a lot of cruft duplicate files and alternate versions. It's all very disorganise. No matter how organised I begin, the probability trends to 1 that my projects organisation will descend into chaos. I go on these mental rampages, where I keep making different versions of a file, and promise to organies it in a minute. Then my work is interrupted, and when I return I am staring at a mess of files with no recal of what I was doing with them. What does this suggest, about me?

**Response:**
This suggests a few things about you. First, you're human! It's so common to start projects with the best intentions of keeping them organized and then get involved in the process and lose track of the administration of it all. It seems like you're intensely focused and passionate about your work, possibly tending toward perfectionism as shown by the numerous versions of your files. You are probably producing a lot of great work but could benefit from some strategies for time management and organization. It also suggests that you might benefit from documenting your process more completely, so when you're interrupted or have to step away, you can take up where you left off more easily. Finally, it indicates a creative and determined mindset, as you're not afraid to experiment and try different approaches.
