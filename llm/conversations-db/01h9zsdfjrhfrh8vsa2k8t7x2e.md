 \n\n This a small project of mine, just two files, Pomedoro.sh, and screen_recorder.sh. As you can see there are a lot of cruft duplicate files and alternate versions. It's all very disorganise. No matter how organised I begin, the probability trends to 1 that my projects organisation will descend into chaos. I go on these mental rampages, where I keep making different versions of a file, and promise to organies it in a minute. Then my work is interrupted, and when I return I am staring at a mess of files with no recal of what I was doing with them. What might this pattern of behaviour suggest? This suggests that you may have the personality type 

**Response:**
INTP (Introverted Intuitive Thinking Perceiving), often referred to as the "thinker" or "logician" personality type. INTPs are known for their intellectual curiosity and creative problem-solving skills. However, they can sometimes struggle with organization and follow-through, often jumping from one exciting idea to the next and leaving a trail of unfinished projects in their wake. It might be beneficial for you to explore techniques that can help bolster your organizational skills, such as time management strategies, project management tools, or working collaboratively with someone who has strengths in areas where you face challenges.

**Prompt:**
Following is a reproduction from my memory of a series of discussions from programmer adhd subreddit (the long messages truncated). About this phenomenon of duplicate files named important_script.sh, importantscript-2.sh, importantscript-2-v1.sh.bak, importantscript-gpt3-edit.sh... scripttest.sh, scripttest1.sh, scripttest2.sh, scripttest2-v2.sh and etc

**Response:**
These discussions reflect a common challenge faced by programmers and developers, especially those working on complex projects or those managing multiple projects simultaneously. 

This challenge often stems from the need to create different versions of a file or script for various purposes - testing different features, maintaining a backup, or preserving different stages of code development. However, this can quickly lead to a disorganized file structure and confusion about the purpose and status of each file.

Frequent naming conventions that become confusing illustrate a lack of an ordered file management or version control system. Common solutions to address this include:

1. Version Control Systems (VCS) like Git: These tools allow you to maintain different versions of your code, track changes, and roll back to previous versions when necessary.
   
2. Consistent Naming Conventions: Establish a naming convention for files and stick to it. The name should reflect the file's purpose or the stage of development it represents.

3. Directory Structures: Organize files in directories according to their purpose. Separate directories for testing, production, and development versions of scripts could be used.

4. Documentation: Maintain a clearly written record explaining the purpose of each file and any modifications made. This is especially important when working in a team or when the project spans over a long period.

The phenomenon of ending up with confusingly named files reflects a common struggle for many developers. Finding a structured system that works personally or for the team is essential in avoiding such confusion and improving productivity.
