**Prompt:**
If it's an idea for some code, then the steps are, roughly: Post my idea (I hit a btn on the streamdeck and get an input box to fill in my idea. I'm constraining this to one or two sentences, short enough to fit in the title of the issue. Otherwise I never know when to stop writing....). The body of the issue will have either url's to related stuff, or search terms that it should use to research ( I'm a lot better at writing search queries than bare chatgpt, but maybe few-shot prompting would improve it. In fact, I just remembered a hot tip about chatgpt web searching, I'll have to try and dig out my example, but I basically asked it to write a paragraph about a subject and then do a websearch. So, it wrote about the thing, and then did the search, which meant it had more context and the overall result was better. .. Anyway, Step 1, my input, step 2 is "hydration". That an automated web search > summarize each result > filter the most relevant > post results to github with a tag to trigger step 3: > Step 4 etc. I haven't decided exactly what those will be, but something like a corporate software design pipeline: Research notes on any existing solutions, or related projects and tools that may be useful. 


**Response:**
Step 1: Prompt idea and gather input.
Step 2: Automate web search, summarize results, and filter relevant information.
Step 3: Post results to GitHub with a trigger tag.
Step 4: Research existing solutions and related projects/tools.
