**Prompt:**
If it's an idea for some code, then the steps are, roughly: Post my idea (I hit a btn on the streamdeck and get an input box to fill in my idea. I'm constraining this to one or two sentences, short enough to fit in the title of the issue. Otherwise I never know when to stop writing....). The body of the issue will have either url's to related stuff, or search terms that it should use to research ( I'm a lot better at writing search queries than bare chatgpt, but maybe few-shot prompting would improve it. In fact, I just remembered a hot tip about chatgpt web searching, I'll have to try and dig out my example, but I basically asked it to write a paragraph about a subject and then do a websearch. So, it wrote about the thing, and then did the search, which meant it had more context and the overall result was better. .. Anyway, Step 1, my input, step 2 is "hydration". That an automated web search > summarize each result > filter the most relevant > post results to github with a tag to trigger step 3: > Step 4 etc. I haven't decided exactly what those will be, but something like a corporate software design pipeline: Research notes on any existing solutions, or related projects and tools that may be useful. 


**Response:**
The steps for implementing your code idea are as follows:
1. Create a button on the streamdeck that allows you to input your idea in a concise manner.
2. Use the input to automate a web search, either by using search terms or providing related URLs.
3. Utilize chatGPT to write a paragraph about the subject and then conduct a web search based on that context to improve the results.
4. Implement the "hydration" step where the code summarizes each search result and filters out the most relevant ones.
5. Post the filtered results on GitHub with a tag that triggers the next step.
6. Define further steps, possibly like a corporate software design pipeline, such as researching existing solutions, related projects, and useful tools.

By following these steps, you can develop your code idea and create a system that automates web searching, summarizing results, and organizing relevant information.
