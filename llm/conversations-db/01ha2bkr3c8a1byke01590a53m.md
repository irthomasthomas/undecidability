**Prompt:**
Write a bash terminal command to perform the following function, or if impossible, write: echo "That request cannot easily be accomplished in a sigle command. Here is spec describing a script that performs the required functions.": how can I see any and all shell commands that get run, even in different processes. So I can see, e.g. why some particular bash function had been called? Be concise, but include much info.


**Response:**
To see all shell commands that get run, including those in different processes, you can use the `strace` command. `strace` is a powerful tool that allows you to trace system calls and signals.

Here is the bash terminal command to achieve this:

```bash
strace -e trace=execve -f <command>
```

Replace `<command>` with the command or script you want to trace. The `-e trace=execve` option specifies that you want to trace the `execve` system call, which is responsible for executing other programs.

The `-f` option tells `strace` to trace child processes as well, so you can see commands executed in different processes.

For example, if you want to trace the execution of a bash function called `my_function`, you can use the following command:

```bash
strace -e trace=execve -f bash -c "my_function"
```

Please note that `strace` can generate a large amount of output, so you may want to redirect it to a file for easier analysis:

```bash
strace -e trace=execve -f <command> > output.txt
```

Keep in mind that `strace` requires root privileges to trace system calls from other processes.
