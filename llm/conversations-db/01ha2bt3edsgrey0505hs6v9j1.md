**Prompt:**
Write a bash terminal command to perform the following function, or if impossible, write: echo "That request cannot easily be accomplished in a sigle command. Here is spec describing a script that performs the required functions.": how can I see any and all shell commands that get run, even in different processes. So I can see, e.g. why some particular bash function had been called? Be concise.


**Response:**
To see all shell commands that get run, even in different processes, you can use the `set -x` command. This command enables the shell's debug mode, which displays each command before it is executed. To disable debug mode, you can use the `set +x` command.
