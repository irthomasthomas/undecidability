**Response:**
This script is used to quickly create a new issue in a project. It prompts the user for a category and a project name (defaulting to the current activity name), creates a directory for the project if it doesn't exist, and then opens a dialog box for the user to enter a quick idea. The idea is then used as the title for the new issue, and a label "idea" is added to it. The issue is created using the GitHub CLI (gh), and the URL of the new issue is displayed in a dialog box.

**Prompt:**
Any problems with it? Think carefully

**Response:**
Upon reviewing the script, I have identified a few potential issues:

1. The `source` command for the `shell_functions.sh` file is commented out, so it is unclear whether the required functions are properly sourced.
2. The `view_new_issue` function is defined but not implemented. It is unclear how the script should handle viewing the new issue.
3. There is a syntax error in the line `target_project=$2:-"$(activity_name_from_id "$(current_activity_id)")"`. The correct syntax for assigning a default value to a variable is `target_project=${2:-"$(activity_name_from_id "$(current_activity_id)")"}`.
4. The `mkdir -p` command is used to create the target project directory, but there is no check to ensure that the directory was successfully created. It would be beneficial to add a check to verify the directory creation.
5. The script assumes that the `kdialog` command is available for displaying dialog boxes. However, this command may not be installed on all systems. It would be helpful to check for the availability of `kdialog` or provide an alternative method for displaying the URL.
6. The script leverages the GitHub CLI (`gh`) to create a new issue. However, it does not account for scenarios where `gh` is not installed or properly configured. It would be wise to check for the presence of `gh` and provide appropriate error handling.

To enhance the script, you may consider addressing these potential issues and ensuring that there are proper error handling mechanisms in place.

**Prompt:**
write the code to check that mkdir succeeded or if there is an error return the error

**Response:**
Certainly! Here's an updated version of the script that includes error handling for the `mkdir` command:

```bash
#!/bin/bash
# Get current Activity
source /home/tommy/Development/linux-stuff/shell_functions.sh

view_new_issue() {
  # Todo: If in a terminal session, use gh cli to view the new issue, else open the url in default browser.
}

Note_Category="$1"
target_project=${2:-"$(activity_name_from_id "$(current_activity_id)")"}
target_project_dir="$HOME/$target_project"

mkdir -p "$target_project_dir"

if [ $? -ne 0 ]; then
  echo "Failed to create the target project directory: $target_project_dir"
  exit 1
fi

cd "$target_project_dir"
idea_text=$(kdialog --inputbox "QuickiDea")
idea_text="Quick idea: $idea_text"
url="$(gh issue create --title "$idea_text" --body "" --label "idea")"

if [ $? -ne 0 ]; then
  echo "Failed to create the new issue"
  exit 1
fi

kdialog --msgbox "$url"
# ToDo: Make "open after add" optional.

```

This updated version uses the `$?` variable to check the exit status of the `mkdir` and `gh` commands. If the exit status is non-zero, it means that an error occurred during the execution of the respective commands. In such cases, the script displays an error message and exits with a non-zero status code.
