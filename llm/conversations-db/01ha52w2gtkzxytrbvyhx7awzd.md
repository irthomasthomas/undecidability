**Prompt:**
example in bash?

**Response:**
In bash, the unary operator can be seen in the following example:

```bash
#!/bin/bash

# Unary operator example
var=5
echo "Value of var: $var"

let "var++"       # Incrementing var using unary operator
echo "Value of var after increment: $var"

let "var--"       # Decrementing var using unary operator
echo "Value of var after decrement: $var"

let "var= -var"   # Changing the sign of var using unary operator
echo "Value of var after changing sign: $var"
```

In this example, the unary operators `++`, `--`, and `-` are used to increment, decrement, and change the sign of the variable `var`, respectively.
