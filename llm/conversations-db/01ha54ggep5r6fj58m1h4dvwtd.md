[INT. LIVING ROOM - DAY]
The room is tidy but cluttered with boxes. MARK, in his early 30s, sits on an old couch, scrolling through his phone. He seems bored and disinterested.

SARAH, his girlfriend, a vibrant woman with a purposeful stride, enters the room. She notices the mess and frowns.

SARAH
(annoyed)
Mark, we need to unpack these boxes. It's been weeks.

MARK
(disinterested)
Yeah, yeah, I'll get to it.

SARAH
(frustrated)
No, it's important to me. This is our home now, and we need to make it feel like one. Can you please help me?

Mark looks up from his phone, seeing her sincerity. He sighs, putting the phone down.

MARK
(finally engaged)
Alright, Sarah. Let's get this done.

They begin unpacking, Sarah carefully organizing and Mark half-heartedly following her lead. As they work, their communication improves.

SARAH
You know, this could be our place to relax and enjoy each other's company.

MARK
(smiling)
Yeah, I guess I've been caught up in my own world lately.

They pick up the pace, laughing and sharing stories. The room starts to feel warmer and more inviting.

SARAH
(teasing)
Oh, and I have a surprise for you. I found this old radio from my grandparents. It still works!

She takes out an antique radio, its wood gleaming and its dials pristine.

MARK
(enthusiastic)
That's amazing! It'll really bring some charm to this place.

They place the radio on a shelf, carefully adjusting it until it sits just right. Sarah turns it on, and the room fills with a soft melody.

MARK
(taking it in)
This music makes all the difference. It feels like home now.

SARAH
(smiling)
I'm glad you finally see it. And you helped create this feeling, too.

They cuddle on the couch, listening to the music together, content in their new home.

FADE OUT.
