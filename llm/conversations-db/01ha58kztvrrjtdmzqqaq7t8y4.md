**Prompt:**
populate a kdialog --combobox from a function that returns a list

**Response:**
To populate a `kdialog` combo box from a function that returns a list, you can use the following steps:

1. Create a shell script file (e.g., `script.sh`) that contains the function returning a list. Here's an example that returns a list of fruits:

```bash
#!/bin/bash

get_fruits() {
  fruits=("Apple" "Banana" "Cherry" "Durian")
  echo "${fruits[@]}"
}

get_fruits
```

2. Make the script executable by running the following command in the terminal:

```bash
chmod +x script.sh
```

3. Use the `kdialog` command to display the combo box dialog. Inside the dialog, call the shell script to retrieve the list of fruits and populate the combo box. Here's an example:

```bash
#!/bin/bash

selected_fruit=$(./script.sh | xargs kdialog --combobox "Select a fruit:")

echo "Selected fruit: ${selected_fruit}"
```

In this example, the `kdialog` command calls the script (`script.sh`) and uses `xargs` to pass the list of fruits as arguments to `kdialog`. The `--combobox` option creates a combo box dialog with the given prompt. The selected fruit will be stored in the `selected_fruit` variable.

4. Save the script and make it executable:

```bash
chmod +x main_script.sh
```

Now, when you run the `main_script.sh` script, the `kdialog` combo box will display the list of fruits. After selecting a fruit, the script will echo the selected fruit to the terminal.

Note: Ensure that you have the `kdialog` package installed on your system for this to work.
