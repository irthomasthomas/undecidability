**Prompt:**
list issues for a specified repo?

**Response:**
To list issues for a specific repository using the `gh s` command, you can follow these steps:

1. Run the `gh s` command with the necessary options to search for the desired repository. For example, to search for the repository named "my-repo", you can use the following command:

   ```
   gh s my-repo
   ```

2. Pipe the output of the `gh s` command to the `xargs` command and specify the `gh issue list` command to view the issues. Use the following command:

   ```
   gh s my-repo | xargs -n1 gh issue list
   ```

   This will list all the issues for the "my-repo" repository.

Please note that you need to have the GitHub CLI (gh) installed and authenticated with your GitHub account for these commands to work.

**Response:**
Apologies for the confusion. It seems there was a misunderstanding in my previous response. The `gh issue list` command itself can be used to list issues for a specific repository. Here are the correct steps to list issues for a specified repository using the `gh issue list` command:

1. Run the `gh issue list` command with the necessary options to specify the repository. For example, to list issues for the repository with the URL "https://github.com/irthomasthomas/undecidability", you can use the following command:

   ```
   gh issue list -R irthomasthomas/undecidability
   ```

   This command will list all the issues for the specified repository.

Please note that you need to have the GitHub CLI (gh) installed and authenticated with your GitHub account for these commands to work.
