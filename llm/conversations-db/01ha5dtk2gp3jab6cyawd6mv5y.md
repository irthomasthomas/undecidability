**Prompt:**
list labels for irthomasthomas/undecidability using gh cli?

**Response:**
To get the list of labels for a GitHub repository using the GitHub CLI (GH CLI), you can use the following command:

```shell
gh api repos/irthomasthomas/undecidability/labels --paginate
```

This command will make an API call to retrieve all the labels for the `irthomasthomas/undecidability` repository and display them in the terminal. The `--paginate` flag is used to display all labels if there are multiple pages.

Note: You need to have the GH CLI installed and authenticated with your GitHub account before running this command.
