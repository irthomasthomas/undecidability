**Response:**
You can use the `select` statement in Bash to create a prompt and choose a label from the list. Here's an example:

```bash
#!/bin/bash

# Run the command and store the output in a variable
label_list=$(gh label list -R irthomasthomas/undecidability)

# Parse the output to extract the label names and store them in an array
labels=($(echo "$label_list" | awk '{print $1}'))

# Prompt the user to select a label
PS3="Choose a label number: "
select label_num in "${labels[@]}"; do
    if [[ -n $label_num ]]; then
        # Get the corresponding label name from the array
        label_name=${labels[$REPLY - 1]}
        echo "Selected label: $label_name"
        break
    else
        echo "Invalid choice. Please select a valid label number."
    fi
done
```

Save the script to a file, make it executable (`chmod +x script.sh`), and then run it. The script will execute the `gh label list` command and display a numbered list of labels. You can select a label by entering its corresponding number, and the script will return the label name.

Note: Make sure you have the `gh` command installed and authenticated with the necessary access rights to run the `gh label list` command.
