**Prompt:**
This did not work. Maybe it can be done with fzf? \n\ngh_issues_label_picker() {
  local labels=$(gh_issues_labels | awk '{print $1}')
  PS3="Choose a label:"
  select label_num in "${labels[@]}"; do
    if [[ -n $label_num ]]; then
      label_name=${labels[$REPLY - 1]}
      echo "Selected label: $label_name"
      break
    else
      echo "Invalid choice. Please select a valid label number."
    fi
  done
}

**Response:**
Yes, it is possible to achieve the desired functionality using fzf. Fzf is a command-line fuzzy finder that can be used to enhance interactive selection in shell scripts. 

Here's an example of how you can modify the code to use fzf:

```bash
gh_issues_label_picker() {
  local labels=$(gh_issues_labels | awk '{print $1}')
  label_name=$(echo "$labels" | fzf)
  
  if [[ -n $label_name ]]; then
    echo "Selected label: $label_name"
  else
    echo "Invalid choice. Please select a valid label."
  fi
}
```

In this updated code, instead of using `select`, we use `fzf` to display the labels and allow the user to select one. The selected label is stored in the `label_name` variable. If the user selects a valid label, it will be echoed as the selected label. Otherwise, an error message will be displayed.

Make sure you have `fzf` installed before using this code. You can install `fzf` by following the instructions on their GitHub page: https://github.com/junegunn/fzf
