**Prompt:**
gh_issues_label_picker() {
  local labels="$(gh_issues_labels)"
  if [[ -t 0 ]]; then
    label_name=$(echo "$labels" | fzf | awk '{print $1}')
  else
    label_name="$(echo labels | awk '{print $1}' | xargs kdialog --combobox "Select an label:" --default "idea")"
  fi
  echo $label_name
}
 Using as few words as possible, explain:\n

**Response:**
This function is used to pick a label from a list of labels for GitHub issues. It first checks if there is a terminal available, and if so, it uses the fzf tool to display the labels in a fuzzy finder for the user to select one. If there is no terminal available, it uses the kdialog tool to display a combobox with the labels for the user to select one. The selected label is then returned by the function.

**Prompt:**
Looks like there is a problem in the else statement?

**Response:**
Yes, there seems to be an issue with the else statement. The variable `labels` should be enclosed in `$()` to execute the command and capture the output, instead of being treated as a string literal. Here's the corrected version of the else statement:

```bash
label_name="$(echo $labels | awk '{print $1}' | xargs kdialog --combobox "Select a label:" --default "idea")"
```

With this modification, the `labels` variable will be replaced with the actual output of the `gh_issues_labels` command, and the correct label can be selected from the combobox.
