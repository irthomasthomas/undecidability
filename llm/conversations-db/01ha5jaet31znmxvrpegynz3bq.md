my_function
 Using as few words as possible, explain:\n

**Response:**
The code defines a function called "my_function" and then calls it. The function code is not shown, but it is expected to echo the message "Function called". The line "unset PS1" is used to unset the value of the PS1 variable, which is typically used to set the prompt in a command line interface.
