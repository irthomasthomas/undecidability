**Prompt:**
Write a good bash scrit.

**Response:**
Here is an example of a simple bash script:

```bash
#!/bin/bash

# Welcome message
echo "Welcome to my Bash script!"

# Prompt for user input
read -p "Enter your name: " name

# Output greeting
echo "Hello, $name!"

# Check if user is an admin
if [[ $EUID -eq 0 ]]; then
   echo "You're an admin!"
else
   echo "You're not an admin."
fi

# List files in current directory
echo "Contents of current directory:"
ls -al

# End message
echo "Script execution complete. Goodbye!"
```

Save the above code in a file with a `.sh` extension, such as `script.sh`. Make sure to give it executable permissions using `chmod +x script.sh`. Then, you can run the script using `./script.sh` in your terminal.

This script prompts the user for their name, greets them, checks if they are an admin by comparing the effective user ID (EUID) with 0, lists the files in the current directory, and finally displays a completion message. Feel free to modify and expand upon the script based on your specific requirements!
