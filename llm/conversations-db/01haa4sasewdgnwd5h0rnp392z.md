In manjaro kde plasma?

**Response:**
There isn't a specific bash command to access clipboard history in Manjaro KDE Plasma either. Clipboard management in KDE Plasma is handled by Klipper, which is a clipboard utility. You can access the clipboard history by using the following command in Konsole:

`klipper`

This will open the Klipper clipboard manager, where you can view and manage your clipboard history.

**Prompt:**
In bash?

**Response:**
In bash, you typically do not have direct access to clipboard history without the help of additional tools or scripting. However, you can use the `xclip` command-line tool to access the clipboard content. To retrieve the clipboard history, you can use the following command:

```bash
xclip -o -selection clipboard-history
```

This command will display the contents of your clipboard history in the terminal. Note that the `xclip` tool may not be installed by default in all systems, so you may need to install it before using this command.
