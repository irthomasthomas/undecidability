**Prompt:**
Tutorial and 10 examples of mitmweb 

**Response:**
Mitmweb is a powerful tool for performing Man-in-the-Middle (MITM) attacks on network traffic. It allows you to intercept and modify HTTP/HTTPS requests and responses in real-time. Here is a tutorial and 10 examples of using mitmweb:

1. Installation: Start by installing mitmweb using pip. Open your command prompt or terminal and run the following command: `pip install mitmproxy`.

2. Start mitmweb: Open your command prompt or terminal and run the following command: `mitmweb`.

3. Access mitmweb interface: Once you start mitmweb, it will display a URL (usually http://127.0.0.1:8081/) to access the web interface. Open your preferred web browser and enter this URL.

4. Configure proxy settings: In your web browser settings, configure the proxy settings to use the localhost address (127.0.0.1) and the port displayed in mitmweb (usually 8080).

5. Intercept and modify requests: Once configured, mitmweb will intercept all HTTP/HTTPS requests and display them in the web interface. You can select a request to view its details and modify the request or response headers or content.

6. Save requests and responses: mitmweb allows you to save intercepted requests and responses for later analysis. You can click on the Save button to save them to your local machine.

7. Injection of code: mitmweb also provides a scripting interface in Python to perform automatic injection of code into intercepted requests or responses. You can write and load scripts to manipulate traffic on the fly.

8. Filtering Requests: mitmweb allows you to filter and search intercepted requests based on various criteria such as request method, URL, response status, etc.

9. Exporting traffic data: mitmweb provides the option to export intercepted traffic data in formats like Curl command, CSV, HAR, and JSON. This can be useful for further analysis or sharing the data with others.

10. SSL certificate management: When intercepting HTTPS traffic, mitmweb generates a custom SSL certificate for each site. You can export these certificates for installation on the client device to allow transparent interception of encrypted traffic.

Example usages of mitmweb:

1. Modifying a request header to include additional information.
2. Manipulating the response content to inject advertisements into web pages.
3. Debugging and inspecting API requests made by a mobile app.
4. Capturing and analyzing requests made by a desktop application.
5. Testing the security of web applications by modifying request parameters.
6. Examining and modifying cookies in real-time.
7. Analyzing and modifying WebSocket traffic.
8. Creating custom scripts to automate repetitive tasks like filling out forms or testing for vulnerabilities.
9. Observing and altering AJAX requests made by a web application.
10. Replaying captured requests to reproduce and diagnose issues.

Keep in mind that while mitmweb is a powerful tool, it should only be used for ethical purposes and with appropriate authorization to perform MITM attacks.

**Prompt:**
Can I set my whole arch linux system to use the proxy? Or does that require a different tool?

**Response:**
Yes, you can set your entire Arch Linux system to use a proxy server. This can be done by configuring the system-wide proxy settings. However, mitmweb alone is not sufficient for setting up a system-wide proxy, as it primarily focuses on intercepting and manipulating network traffic.

To set up a system-wide proxy on Arch Linux, you will need to make use of additional tools. One commonly used tool for managing system-wide proxy settings on Arch Linux is `pacman`. Here's how you can configure a system-wide proxy:

1. Install the `proxychains` package: Open your command prompt or terminal and run the following command: `sudo pacman -S proxychains`.

2. Edit the `proxychains.conf` configuration file: Open the `proxychains.conf` file in a text editor with root privileges. The location of the file is typically `/etc/proxychains.conf`. You can use the `sudo` command to open it with elevated privileges.

3. Configure the proxy server: In the `proxychains.conf` file, uncomment the `dynamic_chain` option by removing the `#` symbol at the beginning, and add your proxy server details under the `[ProxyList]` section. For example:

```
[ProxyList]
http  127.0.0.1  8080
https 127.0.0.1  8080
```

Replace `127.0.0.1` and `8080` with the IP address and port of your proxy server.

4. Save the changes and exit the text editor.

5. Test the proxy setup: To test if the proxy is working system-wide, open a new terminal window and run the following command: `proxychains curl http://example.com`. Replace `http://example.com` with any website URL you want to access.

If the proxy settings are correct, the response should come through the configured proxy server.

Please note that setting up a system-wide proxy may require additional configuration depending on your network environment, such as authentication or proxy exclusion rules. It's important to consult your network administrator or refer to the documentation of your proxy server for accurate setup instructions.
