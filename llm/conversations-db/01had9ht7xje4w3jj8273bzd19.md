**Prompt:**
can I use another user account from the terminal? Arch linux.

**Response:**
Yes, you can use another user account from the terminal in Arch Linux. To switch to another user account, you can use the `su` command. Here's how you can do it:

1. Open the terminal.
2. Type `su - username`, replacing `username` with the actual username of the account you want to switch to. For example, if the username is "john", the command would be `su - john`.
3. Press Enter and you will be prompted to enter the password for the user account.
4. Enter the password and press Enter.

After successful authentication, you will be switched to the other user account. You can now execute commands and perform actions as that user from the terminal. Remember to be cautious and only use this if you have the necessary permissions.
