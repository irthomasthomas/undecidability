**Prompt:**
Think quietly. Write a few paragraphs on: Uncle Bob's Fractured Functions - Draw comparison with novels to illustrate the problem with being corseted by his rules.

**Response:**
Uncle Bob's Fractured Functions is a thought-provoking concept that sheds light on a common issue in programming: the rigid adherence to certain coding principles that limit creativity and hinder the development process. Drawing comparisons with novels can help illustrate the problem that arises when a programmer becomes too confined by Uncle Bob's rules.

In both programming and novel-writing, creativity and innovation are crucial elements for success. A novel is a work of art that allows the author to express their unique ideas, emotions, and storytelling techniques. Similarly, a well-crafted program requires the programmer to think outside the box, find creative solutions, and bring their own individual style to the table.

However, when programmers strictly follow Uncle Bob's rules, they risk becoming corseted and losing the freedom to express their creativity. Itâ€™s like if a novelist were to adhere rigidly to a set of predefined storytelling rules, limiting their exploration and innovation in character development, plotlines, or narrative structures. Such confinement would undoubtedly result in monotony and predictable stories.

Programming, like novel-writing, is not simply a technical task but also an art. Rules and guidelines serve as helpful tools, but they should never overshadow the creative aspect. Creation thrives on diversity, unconstrained thinking, and the ability to break the mold. Uncle Bob's Fractured Functions refers to the consequence of an overly strict adherence to function principles, which can lead to code that is unnecessarily complex, difficult to maintain, and devoid of creativity.

To deliver exceptional results, programmers should strive to find a balance between following industry-wide best practices, including Uncle Bob's principles, and embracing their own style and creativity. Just as novelists can blend traditional storytelling techniques with their unique voices, programmers can combine well-established development practices with out-of-the-box thinking, resulting in code that is both efficient and innovative.

In conclusion, Uncle Bob's Fractured Functions symbolizes the problem that arises when programmers restrict themselves too rigidly to a predefined set of rules in coding. Comparing this situation to novel-writing highlights how creativity and innovation suffer under such constraints. Like novelists, programmers should strike a balance between adhering to guidelines and fostering their creativity to produce exceptional, efficient, and inventive code. By doing so, they can avoid becoming corseted by rules and create programs that are both technically sound and uniquely expressive.
