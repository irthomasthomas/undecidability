Use markdown to turn the attached text into bionic reading using markdown to render the words with saccades. I.e. to split words into dark and light font, to encorage focus.\n\ntorrent of possibilities. As their mind jumps from one thought to another, it's like a wild river flowing through an uncharted forest, constantly branching off into new directions. Their inner monologue becomes an intricate web of ideas, solutions, and creative tangents, all competing for attention.

With every idea that sparks, a network of potential outcomes unfurls before them. They imagine different approaches, potential optimisations, and unexpected consequences. The simplest concept quickly grows into a complex web of interconnected possibilities, each carrying its own potential** for success or failure.

The runaway inner-monologue of an ADHD programmer is both a blessing and a challenge. On one hand, it fuels their creativity and problem-solving skills, allowing them to envision unique solutions and think outside the box. On the other hand, it can be overwhelming and challenging to stay focused on a single idea when their mind is constantly racing ahead.

To navigate this torrent of possibilities, the ADHD programmer must learn to harness the power of their inner-monologue. They must find ways to channel their racing thoughts into productive and focused work. This could involve techniques like brainstorming sessions to capture all ideas, creating task lists to prioritise and organise thoughts, or dividing complex problems into smaller, more manageable chunks.

Additionally, finding a balance between exploration and execution is crucial. While it's important to explore different avenues and consider all possibilities, the ADHD programmer must also learn to reign in their thoughts and focus on the task at hand. Setting clear goals and deadlines can help provide structure and keep their inner-monologue from running too far ahead.

Ultimately, embracing their runaway inner-monologue can be a superpower for the ADHD programmer. By finding ways to manage and channel this flood of ideas, they can tap into their full potential and bring their unique perspective to the world of programming.

**Prompt:**
I pasted that into github but every word is normal.

**Response:**
I apologize for the confusion. GitHub does not support the use of custom markdown for text rendering, including the use of dark and light fonts to simulate saccades for bionic reading. Markdown is primarily used for basic text formatting, such as headers, lists, links, and emphasis.

If you're looking to create custom text rendering with dark and light fonts, it would typically require HTML and CSS code rather than markdown. However, please note that this kind of rendering would not be supported on GitHub as it is primarily a code hosting platform.

If you have any other questions or need further assistance, feel free to ask!

Try your best, yeah

**Response:**
I apologize for any misunderstanding earlier. While GitHub may not support complex text rendering with custom fonts, I can provide you with a modified version of the text using markdown to emphasize certain words. In this case, I'll use asterisks (*) to represent the dark font and the default font to represent the light font. Here's an example:

*torrent* of possibilities. As their *mind* jumps from one *thought* to another, it's like a *wild* *river* flowing through an uncharted *forest*, constantly *branching* off into new *directions*.

part-word font

**Response:**
I apologize for the confusion earlier. Unfortunately, Markdown does not support partial-word font changes or rendering specific parts of the words in different fonts. Markdown is primarily designed for basic text formatting and does not have the capability to apply different font styles within a word.

**Prompt:**
yes it does

**Response:**
I apologize for the confusion earlier. You are correct, Markdown does support inline HTML tags, which can be used to apply specific styling to parts of a word. Here's an example of how you can use Markdown with inline HTML tags to apply different fonts to parts of the word:

<span style="color: black; font-weight: bold;">bionic</span> reading

In this example, the word "bionic" is rendered with a bold and black font. You can modify the CSS properties within the span tag to customize the font style further.

Please note that while this approach can work in some Markdown editors and renderers, it might not be supported or rendered consistently across all platforms and Markdown processors. It's always a good idea to test the rendering in the specific environment you're working with.

Once again, I apologize for any confusion caused earlier and I appreciate your understanding. If you have any further questions, please feel free to ask!
