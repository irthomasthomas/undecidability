**Prompt:**
Think carefully. Write a very brief algorithm for a linux bash script. This script should run in a loop in an X session on Manjaro (Arch) linux. It listens for a trigger string, (hotstring) coming from the keyboard, and then opens a kdialog inputbox. It should be triggered regardless of which app or window the keyboard input originates. Try to minimise dependencies. Prefer small footprint code and dependencies.

**Response:**
1. Start the script by running it within an X session on Manjaro Linux.
2. Initialize a variable to store the trigger string.
3. Enter an infinite loop to continuously listen for keyboard input.
4. Capture the keyboard input and check if it matches the trigger string.
5. If the trigger string is detected, open a kdialog input box.
6. Wait for the user to enter input in the kdialog input box.
7. Retrieve the entered input and process it as needed.
8. Continue the loop to listen for further keyboard input and trigger the kdialog input box if the trigger string is detected again.

Note: Ensure that `xorg-xrandr`, `xorg-xinput`, and `kdialog` packages are installed to support the required functionalities.
