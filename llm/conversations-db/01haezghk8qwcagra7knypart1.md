**Prompt:**
Think carefully. Write a complete solution for the following algorithm in bash. Then I will send to John at corporate for integration testing. Feel free to ask further questions before you proceed.\n\n1. Start the script by running it within an X session on Manjaro Linux.
2. Initialize a variable to store the trigger string.
3. Enter an infinite loop to continuously listen for keyboard input.
4. Capture the keyboard input and check if it matches the trigger string.
5. If the trigger string is detected, open a kdialog input box.
6. Wait for the user to enter input in the kdialog input box.
7. Retrieve the entered input and process it as needed.
8. Continue the loop to listen for further keyboard input and trigger the kdialog input box if the trigger string is detected again.

**Response:**
Sure! Here's the complete solution for the given algorithm in bash:

```bash
#!/bin/bash

# Step 1: Start the script within an X session on Manjaro Linux
# Make sure you're running this script from within an X session.

# Step 2: Initialize a variable to store the trigger string
trigger="example_trigger"

# Step 3: Enter an infinite loop to continuously listen for keyboard input
while true; do
  # Step 4: Capture the keyboard input and check if it matches the trigger string
  read -n "${#trigger}" input
  
  if [[ $input == $trigger ]]; then
    # Step 5: If the trigger string is detected, open a kdialog input box
    userInput=$(kdialog --title "Input Box" --inputbox "Please enter your input:")
    
    # Step 6: Wait for the user to enter input in the kdialog input box
    # (No explicit wait is needed in this case as kdialog is a blocking command)
    
    # Step 7: Retrieve the entered input and process it as needed
    echo "User entered: $userInput"
    
    # Step 8: Continue the loop to listen for further keyboard input and trigger the kdialog input box if the trigger string is detected again
    continue
  fi
done
```

Make sure you have Manjaro Linux with X server installed, as some commands like `kdialog` might be specific to certain environments.

Please let me know if you have any further questions!
