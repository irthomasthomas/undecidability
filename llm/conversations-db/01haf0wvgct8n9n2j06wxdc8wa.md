**Prompt:**
### Requirements:
- The script should run in a loop within an X session on Manjaro Linux.
- It should listen for the trigger word 'aoeu' entered from the keyboard.
- The script should only trigger when the entire trigger word has been typed.
- Once the trigger word is detected, the script should open a kdialog input box.
- After the user enters input in the kdialog input box, the entered input should be processed.

### Algorithm:
1. Initialize a variable trigger_word and set it to 'aoeu'.
2. Initialize a variable input_buffer and set it to an empty string.
3. Enter an infinite loop.
4. Capture keyboard input.
5. Append the captured input to the input_buffer.
6. Check if the input_buffer matches the trigger_word.
7. If the trigger_word is detected (full match), open a kdialog input box.
8. Wait for the user to enter input in the kdialog input box and retrieve it.
9. Process the entered input as needed.
10. Reset the input_buffer to an empty string after processing the trigger.
11. Continue the loop to listen for further keyboard input.
 Using as few words as possible, explain:\n

**Response:**
The script continuously listens for the trigger word 'aoeu' entered from the keyboard in an X session on Manjaro Linux. Once the trigger word is detected, it opens a kdialog input box for the user to enter input. The entered input is then processed, and the script continues to listen for further trigger words.
