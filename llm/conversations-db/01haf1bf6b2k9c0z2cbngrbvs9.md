**Prompt:**
Think carefully. Write a very brief algorithm for a linux bash script. This script should run a GUI session and should monitor keyinput from any buffer, application window, or dialog. Please note the user does not have terminal access, so the script should use dialog boxes and notifications to communicate. For ease, assume KDE Plasma and kdialag for this. It listens for a trigger string, (hotstring) coming from the keyboard, and then opens a kdialog inputbox. It should be triggered regardless of which app or window the keyboard input originates. Try to minimise dependencies. Prefer small footprint code and dependencies.

**Response:**
1. Import the necessary libraries and dependencies. 
2. Create a function to monitor the keyboard input in the background:
   a. Use `xinput` command to get the ID of the keyboard device.
   b. Use `xinput test <keyboard-device-ID>` command to continuously monitor the keyboard input.
   c. Write a loop to check for the trigger string in the input received.
   d. Once the trigger string is found, show a kdialog input box using `kdialog --inputbox "Enter input:"`.
   e. Process the input received from the kdialog box.
   f. Continue monitoring the keyboard input after processing.
3. Call the function to start monitoring the keyboard input.
4. Display a notification using `kdialog` to indicate that the script is running.
5. Run a GUI session using the appropriate command for KDE Plasma.
6. When the GUI session ends, stop monitoring the keyboard input.
7. Display a notification using `kdialog` to indicate that the script has stopped.

Note: Make sure to set the executable permission for the bash script using `chmod +x script.sh`.
