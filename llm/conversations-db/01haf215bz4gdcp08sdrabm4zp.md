**Prompt:**
Think carefully. Write a concise algorithm for a linux bash script. This script should run a GUI session and should monitor keyinput from any buffer, application window, or dialog. Please note the user does not have terminal access, so the script should use dialog boxes and notifications to communicate. For ease, assume KDE Plasma and kdialag for this. It listens for a trigger string, (hotstring) coming from the keyboard, and then opens a kdialog inputbox. It should be triggered regardless of which app or window the keyboard input originates. Try to minimise dependencies. Prefer small footprint code and dependencies.

**Response:**
Here is a concise algorithm for a Linux bash script that meets the requirements mentioned:

1. Check if KDE Plasma is running by verifying the presence of the `dbus-daemon` process. If not found, display an error notification using `kdialog` and exit.
2. Create a temporary file to store the hotstring.
3. Monitor keyboard events using `xinput` or `XRecord` to detect the hotstring.
4. When the hotstring is detected:
    a. Display a notification using `kdialog` to inform the user that the hotstring was triggered.
    b. Open a kdialog inputbox to collect user input.
    c. Process the input as required by your application.
5. Remove the temporary file and exit gracefully when the script is terminated.

Here's a sample script implementing the above algorithm:

```bash
#!/bin/bash

# Check if KDE Plasma is running
if ! pgrep "dbus-daemon" >/dev/null 2>&1; then
    kdialog --msgbox "KDE Plasma is not running. Please start a KDE session." 0 0
    exit 1
fi

# Temporary file to store the hotstring
temp_file="/tmp/hotstring_trigger.tmp"

# Function to display a kdialog inputbox and process user input
get_user_input() {
    user_input=$(kdialog --title "Hotstring Triggered" --inputbox "Please enter your input:" 0 0 "$1" 2>&1)
    # Process the user input as required by your application
    # ...
}

# Monitor keyboard events
xinput test-xi2 --root | while IFS= read -r line; do
    if [[ $line =~ "keycode" && $line =~ "KP_End" ]]; then
        > "$temp_file"  # Create the temporary file triggering the hotstring
        get_user_input "$(cat "$temp_file")"
        rm "$temp_file"
    fi
done

# Remove the temporary file and exit gracefully
trap 'rm -f "$temp_file"' EXIT
```
