**Prompt:**
Which is best value then?

**Response:**
Determining the "best value" depends on the specific context or criteria you are evaluating. Value can be subjective and vary based on individual preferences, needs, and circumstances. However, I can provide some general factors that are often considered when evaluating value:

1. Price: The cost of a product or service relative to its perceived benefits or quality.
2. Quality: The overall excellence or superiority of a product or service in terms of its intended purpose.
3. Durability: The ability of a product to maintain its quality and performance over an extended period.
4. Functionality: The extent to which a product or service meets the desired needs and performs its intended functions effectively.
5. Features: Additional attributes or capabilities that enhance the usefulness or convenience of a product or service.
6. Customer Support: The level of assistance, support, or warranty provided by the company for the product or service.
7. Reputation: The overall perception of the brand or company in terms of trustworthiness, reliability, and customer satisfaction.

Considering these factors and your specific requirements, you can assess the value offered by different options and make a decision based on your personal priorities and circumstances.

**Prompt:**
Calculate the cost per wash

**Response:**
To calculate the cost per wash, you need to know the total cost of detergent or laundry supplies and the number of washes that can be done using that quantity. The formula for calculating the cost per wash is:

Cost per wash = Total cost of detergent / Number of washes

For example, let's say you purchased a bottle of laundry detergent for $15, and the bottle specifies that it can be used for 30 washes. Using the formula mentioned above:

Cost per wash = $15 / 30 washes
Cost per wash = $0.50

Therefore, the cost per wash in this scenario would be $0.50.
