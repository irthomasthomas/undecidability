**Prompt:**
Think it through carefully. Be careful of trick questions! \n Q: I left 5 items of clothing out to dry and it took 5 hours. How long would it take to dry 30 items of clothing?

**Response:**
To solve this problem, we can assume that each item of clothing takes the same amount of time to dry. 

If it took 5 hours to dry 5 items of clothing, we can deduce that it takes 1 hour to dry each item of clothing (since 5 hours divided by 5 items gives us 1 hour per item).

Therefore, if we have 30 items of clothing, it would take 30 hours to dry them all. 

So, the answer is: It would take 30 hours to dry 30 items of clothing.
