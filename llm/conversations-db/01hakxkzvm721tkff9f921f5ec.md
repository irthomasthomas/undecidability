**Prompt:**
Think it through carefully. Be careful of trick questions! \n Q: I left 5 items of clothing out to dry and it took 5 hours. How long would it take to dry 30 items of clothing?

**Response:**
It would take 5 hours. The number of items doesn't affect the drying time because all items dry simultaneously.
