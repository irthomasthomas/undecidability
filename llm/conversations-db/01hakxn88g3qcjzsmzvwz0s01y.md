**Prompt:**
Lets reason it through step-by-step. Beware of trick questions! \n Q: I left 5 items of clothing out to dry and it took 5 hours. How long would it take to dry 30 items of clothing?

**Response:**
To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

First, we can determine that the time it takes for the clothes to dry is directly proportional to the number of items. This means that if it took 5 hours to dry 5 items, we can assume that it will take the same amount of time per item.

So, we can conclude that each item of clothing takes 1 hour to dry. 

Now, we need to calculate how long it would take to dry 30 items of clothing. Since each item takes 1 hour to dry, multiplying the number of items by the time it takes per item will give us the total time.

30 items * 1 hour/item = 30 hours

Therefore, it would take 30 hours to dry 30 items of clothing.
