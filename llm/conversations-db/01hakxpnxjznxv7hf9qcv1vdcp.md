**Prompt:**
Q: I left 5 items of clothing out to dry and it took 5 hours. How long would it take to dry 30 items of clothing?

**Response:**
To solve this question, we need to first identify the relationship between the number of items of clothing and the time it takes to dry them.

In this case, we know that 5 items of clothing took 5 hours to dry. We can therefore conclude that each item of clothing takes 1 hour to dry.

Now, if we have 30 items of clothing, we can assume that each item will take 1 hour to dry. Therefore, it would take 30 hours to dry all 30 items of clothing.

So, the answer is 30 hours.
