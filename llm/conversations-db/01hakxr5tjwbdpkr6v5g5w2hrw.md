**Prompt:**
Q: I left 5 items of clothing out to dry and it took 5 hours. How long would it take to dry 30 items of clothing?

**Response:**
The time it takes to dry the clothing depends on various factors such as the size of the clothing, the weather conditions, and the drying method. However, if we assume that all the conditions remain the same, it would still take 5 hours to dry 30 items of clothing. The number of items does not affect the drying time in this scenario.
