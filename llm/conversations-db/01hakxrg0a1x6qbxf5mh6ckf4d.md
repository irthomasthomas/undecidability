**Prompt:**
Q: I left 5 items of clothing out to dry and it took 5 hours. How long would it take to dry 30 items of clothing?

**Response:**
A: The question does not specify whether the drying time is linearly proportional to the number of items. It could be that each item takes 1 hour to dry regardless of the quantity. In that case, it would take 30 hours to dry 30 items. However, if the drying time is based on the total number of items, then it would still take 5 hours to dry 30 items, assuming they can dry simultaneously.
