**Prompt:**
When I am in Activity1 and I open a kate document, it opens in the kate window that is on Activity2. Is there any way to change that behavior? Or no?


**Response:**
Yes, there is a way to change that behavior in KDE Plasma. You can configure the window behavior for specific applications by right-clicking on the title bar of the application window, selecting "More Actions," and then choosing "Special Application Settings."

In the "Special Application Settings" window, go to the "Size & Position" tab. Under "Activities," you can select "Force" or "Remember" for the desired activity where you want the application to open. 

Choose "Force" to make the application always open in that specific activity. Choose "Remember" to make the application remember which activity it was last opened in and open there next time.

Please note that this solution assumes you have configured activities in KDE Plasma. Let me know if you need further assistance or more detailed instructions.

**Prompt:**
But if I have kate open in two activities?

**Response:**
If you have the Kate application open in two activities, it is not currently possible to change the behavior you described. At present, KDE Plasma does not have a built-in feature to restrict application windows to specific instances across activities. 

Each instance of an application like Kate is considered separate, and its behavior is not tied to a specific activity. Therefore, when you open a document in one instance, it can appear in any instance of Kate across different activities.

However, you can try using a workaround by manually moving or placing the Kate windows in the desired activities when you open them. This way, you can have more control over which activity a particular Kate window appears in.

Alternatively, you can try using different text editors like KWrite or FeatherPad, which do not support multiple instances, if having documents open in specific activities is crucial for your workflow.

Let me know if you need further assistance or have any other questions.
