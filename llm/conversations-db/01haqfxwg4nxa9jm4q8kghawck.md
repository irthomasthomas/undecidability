**Prompt:**
How to use precmd in zsh to save the output of every command?

**Response:**
To save the output of every command in Zsh using `precmd`, you can follow these steps:

1. Open your `.zshrc` file in a text editor.

2. Locate the section where you configure your `precmd` function. If it doesn't exist, add the following code to create the function:
```shell
precmd() {
    # Your code here
}
```

3. Within the `precmd()` function, create a variable to store the output of the last command:
```shell
precmd() {
    local last_output=$?
    
    # Your code here
}
```

4. Use the `print` command to write the output of the last command to a file. You can specify the desired file path. For example, to save all command outputs in a file named `command_output.txt` located in your home directory:
```shell
precmd() {
    local last_output=$?
    
    print -s "$?: $(fc -ln -1)" >> ~/command_output.txt
}
```
The `print -s` command appends the output of the last command with its exit status (`$?`) to the specified file.

5. Save and close the `.zshrc` file.

6. Finally, reload the `zsh` configuration by running:
```shell
source ~/.zshrc
```

Now, every time you execute a command, its output will be saved in the specified file along with its exit status.
