**Prompt:**
How can I pipe the output of a command to my own script?


**Response:**
To pipe the output of a command to your own script, you can use the read command in your script to read the input from the pipe. Here's an example:

```bash
#!/bin/bash

# Read input from pipe
while read line; do
  # Process each line of input here
  echo "Received input: $line"
done 
```

You can then use the pipe operator (`|`) to redirect the output of a command to your script. For example, if your script is named `my_script.sh` and you want to pipe the output of the command `ls` to your script, you can do:

```
ls | ./my_script.sh
```
