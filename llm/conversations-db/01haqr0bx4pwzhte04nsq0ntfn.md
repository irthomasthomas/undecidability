**Prompt:**
How should I change the jq command now that I am reading from stdin?/nwhile read line; do
    input+=$line
done

# Read the JSON and prettify it using jq
json=$(jq '.' "$input")

**Response:**
To modify the `jq` command to read from stdin, you can use the `-` symbol as a placeholder for stdin. Here's how you can modify the code:

```bash
while read line; do
    input+=$line
done

# Read the JSON from stdin and prettify it using jq
json=$(echo "$input" | jq '.')
```

In this updated code, the `echo` command is used to send the content stored in the `$input` variable to stdin. Then, the `jq` command receives the JSON input from stdin and prettifies it. The resulting prettified JSON is assigned to the `$json` variable.
