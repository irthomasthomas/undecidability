**Prompt:**
Think carefully. Write a long but concise list of some of the more advanced and rarely used features of ffmpeg on linux.

**Response:**
Sure! Here is a long but concise list of some of the more advanced and rarely used features of FFmpeg on Linux:

1. Hardware Acceleration: FFmpeg supports hardware acceleration using various frameworks such as VA-API, VDPAU, and NVENC, allowing you to offload encoding and decoding tasks to your GPU.

2. Advanced Video Filters: FFmpeg provides a wide range of video filters, including noise reduction, deinterlacing, denoising, color correction, video stabilization, and more.

3. Complex Video Transcoding: FFmpeg allows complex video transcoding operations such as changing video codecs, frame rate adjustments, bitrate control, and resolution scaling with precise control.

4. Audio and Video Synchronization: FFmpeg supports various synchronization techniques, like adjusting audio delay, syncing multiple audio and video streams, and handling timecodes.

5. Subtitle Manipulation: FFmpeg allows you to extract, manipulate, and burn subtitles into videos. It supports multiple subtitle formats, including SRT, ASS, VobSub, and more.

6. Network Streaming: FFmpeg is capable of streaming multimedia content over network protocols such as HTTP, RTP, RTMP, and multicast, enabling live streaming and video-on-demand setups.

7. Video Concatenation and Splitting: FFmpeg can concatenate multiple videos into a single file or split a single video into multiple segments based on time or size.

8. Audio and Video Mixing: FFmpeg allows you to combine audio and video from multiple sources, apply volume adjustments, specify input/output streams, and even create picture-in-picture effects.

9. Frame Interpolation: FFmpeg supports advanced frame interpolation techniques like motion compensation and blending, allowing you to create smooth slow-motion or high frame rate videos.

10. Advanced Codecs and Containers: FFmpeg supports a vast range of video and audio codecs, including H.265 (HEVC), VP9, AV1, Opus, AAC, and more. It can also handle various container formats such as MP4, MKV, MOV, and MPEG-TS.

11. Audio Manipulation: FFmpeg provides tools to manipulate audio streams by adjusting volume, applying filters like equalization and noise reduction, changing pitch, and converting between audio formats.

12. Image Sequence Handling: FFmpeg can treat a sequence of images as a video input, allowing you to encode image sequences into videos or extract frames from videos as individual images.

13. FFprobe: FFmpeg comes with FFprobe, a powerful tool to analyze media files and extract metadata like video bitrate, audio channels, duration, and more. It supports JSON output, making it easy to integrate with other programs.

14. Advanced Presets and Encoding Parameters: FFmpeg allows users to fine-tune encoding parameters, specify custom presets, tune encoder settings, and apply advanced compression techniques.

15. GPU Filters: FFmpeg supports GPU-based video filtering using frameworks like OpenCL and CUDA. This enables accessing specialized GPU filters and harnessing the power of the GPU for demanding video processing tasks.

Remember that FFmpeg is a complex and versatile tool, and this list only scratches the surface of its capabilities. Consulting the official FFmpeg documentation and exploring community forums can provide further insights into these features and more.
