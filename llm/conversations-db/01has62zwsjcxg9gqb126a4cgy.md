**Prompt:**
How can I diagnose why my cpu governor is being set to ondemand?


**Response:**
To diagnose why your CPU governor is being set to "ondemand," you can follow these steps:

1. Open the Terminal.
2. Type the following command to check the current CPU governor:
   ```
   cpupower frequency-info
   ```

   If cpupower is not installed, you can install it by running:
   ```
   sudo pacman -S cpupower
   ```

   Note: If cpupower is not available, you can use other tools like `cpufrequtils` or `cpufreq-info` instead.

3. The command output will display the current CPU governor.
4. Check if the governor is already set to "ondemand." If it's not, it means another process or script is changing the governor.
5. If the governor is already set to "ondemand," there may be a configuration file overriding the default settings. Check the following file for any custom configurations:

   ```
   /etc/default/cpupower
   ```

   Open the file using a text editor and look for any specific governor settings. Comment out or remove any lines that set the governor to "ondemand."

6. If no custom configurations are found, check if any power management tools or scripts are running in the background. These tools can dynamically change the CPU governor based on system conditions. Use the following command to list active processes related to power management:

   ```
   ps -aux | grep power
   ```

   Review the list for any power management tools or scripts that might be setting the governor to "ondemand."

7. If you identify any power management tools or scripts, you can either configure them to use a different governor or disable them if not needed.

Remember, the steps may vary depending on your specific system setup. If you need more detailed information, please let me know.

**Prompt:**
cat /etc/default/cpupower
# Define CPUs governor
# valid governors: ondemand, performance, powersave, conservative, userspace.
governor='performance'

**Response:**
Based on the output of the `/etc/default/cpupower` file, the CPU governor is set to "performance" rather than "ondemand." Therefore, the governor is not being set to "ondemand" by this configuration file.

To identify why your CPU governor is set to "ondemand," you may need to investigate further and check for other potential sources that could be changing the governor setting. You can follow the remaining steps mentioned in my previous response to identify any power management tools, scripts, or other configurations that might be overriding the governor setting.
