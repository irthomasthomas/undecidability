**Prompt:**
Think carefully, how do boot manjaro to a tty without launching the full kde desktop?


**Response:**
To boot Manjaro to a TTY without launching the full KDE desktop, you can follow these steps:

1. Start your computer and wait for the GRUB menu to appear.
2. Use the arrow keys to highlight the Manjaro entry.
3. Press the "e" key to edit the boot parameters.
4. Scroll down to the line that starts with "linux" or "linuxefi".
5. At the end of that line, add a space followed by "3" or "single".
   - Adding "3" will boot into the TTY without any graphical interface.
   - Adding "single" will also boot into the TTY, but with root privileges.
6. Press "Ctrl + X" or "F10" to boot with the modified parameters.

This should allow you to boot into a TTY without launching the full KDE desktop. Note that this method assumes you have a typical GRUB bootloader configuration. If you have a different bootloader or customized setup, the steps may vary.

**Prompt:**
Can I still launch a vm with a graphical environment doing that?

**Response:**
Booting into a TTY without launching the full KDE desktop will disable the graphical environment on the host machine, which means you won't be able to have a graphical environment on the host while in the TTY.

However, you can still launch a virtual machine (VM) with a graphical environment by using a virtualization software that supports graphical output redirection. For example, you can use VirtualBox or QEMU with the appropriate options to redirect the graphical output to your host's graphical environment.

Keep in mind that launching a VM with a graphical environment may require additional resources and may affect the performance of your host system, especially if you are running the VM on the same machine.

If you provide more specific details about the virtualization software you plan to use, I can provide more detailed instructions on how to launch a VM with a graphical environment.

**Prompt:**
Qemu

**Response:**
To launch a QEMU virtual machine with a graphical environment while booted into a TTY without the full KDE desktop, you can use the following command:

```
qemu-system-x86_64 -enable-kvm -m 2G -hda path_to_image.qcow2 -cdrom path_to_iso.iso -boot d -vga virtio -display sdl
```

Replace `path_to_image.qcow2` with the path to your virtual machine image (in QCOW2 format), and `path_to_iso.iso` with the path to the ISO file of your preferred operating system.

This command will start the QEMU virtual machine with the `-vga virtio` option, which enables a virtual graphics card using the virtio driver, and the `-display sdl` option, which tells QEMU to display the graphical output using the Simple DirectMedia Layer (SDL).

Make sure you have the necessary permissions to access the virtualization features on your host machine (such as executing QEMU as root or being a member of the appropriate group).

Note that the exact command and options may vary depending on your specific setup and requirements. Be sure to consult the QEMU documentation or the documentation of the specific distribution or tool you are using for further information and customization options.

**Prompt:**
Cant i just launch x11 without launching kde plasma?

**Response:**
Yes, you can launch X11 without launching the full KDE Plasma desktop environment. 

To do this, you can use the `startx` command, which starts the X Window System and launches a graphical environment. Here's how you can use it:

1. Boot your system into a TTY without launching the full KDE Plasma desktop.
2. Log in with your username and password.
3. Run the following command to start X11:

   ```
   startx
   ```

This will launch a basic X session with a default window manager. You will have access to a graphical environment, but it won't include the full KDE Plasma desktop.

If you have already installed a lightweight window manager like Openbox or Fluxbox, you can specify it as an argument to `startx` to use it instead of the default window manager. For example:

```
startx /usr/bin/openbox
```

Remember to replace `/usr/bin/openbox` with the actual path to the window manager executable.

Keep in mind that running X11 without a desktop environment like KDE Plasma may require manual configuration and setup of additional software and utilities to provide a functional user interface.
