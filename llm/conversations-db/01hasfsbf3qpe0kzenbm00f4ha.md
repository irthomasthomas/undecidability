**Prompt:**
And what does that do?

**Response:**
Setting the default target to multi-user mode means that the system will start up without graphical interfaces or desktop environments. It will boot to a command line interface, allowing multiple users to log in and use the system. Rebooting the system after setting the default target applies this change and restarts the system.
