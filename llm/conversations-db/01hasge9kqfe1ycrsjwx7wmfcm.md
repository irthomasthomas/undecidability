**Prompt:**
Think carefully. After running the following command, I am now in a terminal. How can I start quickemu vm? /n/n sudo systemctl set-default multi-user.target && sudo reboot

**Response:**
After running the above command and entering the terminal, you have set the default target to "multi-user.target" and initiated a reboot. Once your system reboots, you can start the quickemu VM by following these steps:

1. Wait for the system to reboot and reach the login screen.
2. Log in to your user account.
3. Open a terminal window if it doesn't open automatically.
4. In the terminal, run the following command to start the quickemu VM:
   ```
   quickemu -e -c /path/to/config/file
   ```
   Replace `/path/to/config/file` with the actual path to your quickemu configuration file.
5. Press Enter to execute the command.
6. The quickemu VM should start, and you will be able to interact with it.

Note: Make sure you have installed quickemu and have a valid configuration file for your VM before running the command in step 4.
