**Prompt:**
There is no display manager running

**Response:**
If there is no display manager running, you can start the quickemu virtual machine in the terminal without a graphical interface by following these steps:

1. Open a terminal window.
2. Run the command `quickemu -vnographics -vm <vm-name>`, replacing `<vm-name>` with the name of the virtual machine you want to start.
3. Wait for the virtual machine to initialize and boot up.

The `-vnographics` option tells quickemu to start the virtual machine without a graphical interface, which can be useful in situations where a display manager is not available or required.

Note that without a display manager, you won't have a graphical user interface and will interact with the virtual machine solely through the terminal.

**Prompt:**
How can I get a minimal display manager running?

**Response:**
To get a minimal display manager running, you can install and configure a lightweight display manager such as LightDM or LXDM. Here's a step-by-step guide:

1. Ensure you have a terminal open.

2. Install the display manager. For LightDM, you can use the following command:
```bash
sudo apt-get install lightdm
```
For LXDM, you can use:
```bash
sudo apt-get install lxdm
```

3. After the installation is complete, configure the display manager. For LightDM, use the following command:
```bash
sudo dpkg-reconfigure lightdm
```
For LXDM, use:
```bash
sudo dpkg-reconfigure lxdm
```
You may be prompted to select the default display manager. Choose the desired display manager and press Enter.

4. Now, start the display manager by running the following command:
```bash
sudo service lightdm start
```
or
```bash
sudo service lxdm start
```

5. The display manager should start, and you will be presented with a graphical login screen. You can log in with your username and password.

Keep in mind that minimal display managers may have limited features compared to full-fledged desktop environments.

**Prompt:**
service command not found

**Response:**
If the `service` command is not found, it suggests that you might be using a Linux distribution that uses a different service management tool, such as `systemctl`. Here's an alternative method to start the display manager using `systemctl`:

1. Open a terminal window.

2. To install LightDM, use the following command:
```bash
sudo apt-get install lightdm
```
For LXDM, use:
```bash
sudo apt-get install lxdm
```

3. After the installation is complete, enable the display manager to start at boot:
```bash
sudo systemctl enable lightdm
```
or
```bash
sudo systemctl enable lxdm
```

4. Now, start the display manager using the following command:
```bash
sudo systemctl start lightdm
```
or
```bash
sudo systemctl start lxdm
```

5. The display manager should now start, and you will be presented with a graphical login screen where you can enter your username and password.

Please note that the commands provided assume you are using a Debian-based distribution such as Ubuntu. For other distributions, the package names and commands may vary slightly.
