**Prompt:**
That did not work. I still cannot access it

**Response:**
Apologies for the confusion. In order to grant read/write access to the user "tommy" for the directory /home/newt and all its subdirectories, you need to use the "chown" command instead of "chmod". Please try the following command:

sudo chown -R tommy /home/newt

This command will change the ownership of the directory and all its subdirectories to the user "tommy".

**Prompt:**
And then user newt loses access?

**Response:**
Apologies for the oversight. If you want to grant read/write access to both the user "tommy" and the original user "newt" for the directory /home/newt and all its subdirectories, you can use the "chown" command in combination with the "chmod" command. Please try the following commands:

sudo chown -R tommy:newt /home/newt
sudo chmod -R u+rwX,g+rwX,o-rwx /home/newt

The first command changes the ownership of the directory and all its subdirectories to the user "tommy" and the group "newt". The second command grants read/write access to the user and group, while restricting access for others.

**Prompt:**
I have added both users to the group twousers

**Response:**
If the users "tommy" and "newt" are members of the "twousers" group, and you want to grant read/write access to the group "twousers" for the directory /home/newt and all its subdirectories, you can use the following command:

sudo chown -R :twousers /home/newt
sudo chmod -R g+rwX /home/newt

The first command changes the group ownership of the directory and all its subdirectories to "twousers". The second command grants read/write access to the group for the directory and its subdirectories.

Please make sure both users are members of the "twousers" group for this to work as expected.
