**Prompt:**
 llm logs list -q '"that request cannot"' -n 1 --json | jq -r  '.[] | {prompt, system, options_json, response_json, conversation_id, duration_ms, datetime_utc, conversation_name}' | jq . | sh /home/tommy/undecidability/llm_to_markdown.sh
jq: parse error: Invalid numeric literal at line 1, column 113

**Response:**
It appears you have an error somewhere in your command line input. The `jq` tool, short for JSON processor, is signaling a parse error translating the following command:

`'.[] | {prompt, system, options_json, response_json, conversation_id, duration_ms, datetime_utc, conversation_name}'`

Specifically, the error is at line 1, column 113 where there's an "Invalid numeric literal." 

You might want to ensure that your JSON file or stream is valid, and that you're providing correct and expected data types, especially when dealing with numbers (which the error seemed to indicate). If possible, try to use a JSON validator tool to verify the structure and data of your JSON content.

Also, it seems you're using a script `llm_to_markdown.sh`, you may want to verify and troubleshoot that shell script as well. 

And another possible cause for this error might be a misuse of the `-q` option which is not standard in `jq` command.

If you could provide more context or details about the exact data you're working with and the expected output, it would be easier to troubleshoot and provide you with a more specific solution. 

However, always ensure your JSON input is properly formatted and valid, and validate your shell script for any potential issues.

**Response:**
It looks like the script `llm_to_markdown.sh` is intended to read a line of input, parse the JSON content, and generate a GitHub Markdown formatted issue text based on the data from the JSON.

The error message you're seeing may not be directly linked to the script `llm_to_markdown.sh`, but rather the input that's being piped into it. Depending on the actual JSON content you're dealing with, the error might be stemming from the highlight search query (`-q '"that request cannot"'`) parsed to the `llm logs list` command or the JSON format of the logs from this command in the first place.

To debug this, you could manually pipe a known, valid JSON string into the script to verify its operation:

```bash
echo '{ "prompt": "Test prompt", "response_json": { "content": "Test content", "role": "assistant", "model": "Test model", "created": 1234567890 }, "datetime_utc": "2020-01-01T00:00:00.000Z", "conversation_name": "Test conversation" }' | sh /home/tommy/undecidability/llm_to_markdown.sh
```

Please replace the `echo` part with your actual JSON content.

If this works, then it suggests that the problem might be in the way you're retrieving the logs or the JSON they contain. In this case, you might need to go back to verify what the `llm logs list` command is delivering and adjust the search query accordingly.

When interpreting or troubleshooting complex command line operations like these, it's often helpful to break down the pipeline and examine each component in isolation. In this case, that means looking at what the `llm logs list` command produces, then what this output looks like after it is passed to `jq .`, and finally what happens when it is piped to `sh /home/tommy/undecidability/llm_to_markdown.sh`.
