jq: parse error: Invalid numeric literal at line 1, column 113

**Response:**
It would appear that there might be an error with the parsing. The `jq` command is used to work with JSON data and the error message suggests that there's a problem with the number on line 1, column 113 of the input. 

Make sure that you are providing valid JSON data as input for this script. The error may originate from the 'jq' command not being able to correctly parse the input as valid JSON. You need to make sure that whatever is generating your JSON is properly formatting it.

Also, you could be facing this problem if your JSON data does not match up with the input you are trying to parse from it using 'jq'. Make sure that the fields you are trying to extract from the JSON data actually exist within the data itself.

Unfortunately, without seeing the actual JSON data you are passing to the script, it's hard to diagnose further.
