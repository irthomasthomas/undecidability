jq: parse error: Invalid numeric literal at line 1, column 113

**Response:**
It appears you're encountering an error parsing a JSON object due to an invalid numeric literal. This happens when `jq` tries to interpret a string as a number. Review your JSON input or your `jq` statements to ensure they're well-formed and using the correct types. 

118 characters into your JSON input, you have `"temperature": 0.0`. This could potentially be causing the problem if `jq` expects an integer.

You might want to consider modifying your bash script as follows:

```bash
#!/bin/bash

while read line; do
    input+=$line
done

# Read the JSON and prettify it using jq
json=$(echo "$input" | jq '.')

# Extract the required fields from the JSON
id=$(echo $json | jq -r '.id')
prompt=$(echo $json | jq -r '.prompt')
content=$(echo $json | jq -r '.response_json.content')
role=$(echo $json | jq -r '.response_json.role')
model=$(echo $json | jq -r '.response_json.model')
created=$(echo $json | jq -r '.response_json.created')
datetime_utc=$(echo $json | jq -r '.datetime_utc')
conversation_name=$(echo $json | jq -r '.conversation_name')

# Generate the GitHub Markdown issue
issue_text="**Prompt:** $prompt\n
**Content:** $content\n
**Role:** $role\n
**Model:** $model\n
**Datetime UTC:** $datetime_utc\n
**Conversation Name:** $conversation_name\n"

# Print the Markdown issue
echo -e "$issue_text"
```
Here `\n` is being used to add newlines in between each line of the printed output. Also, `-e` has been added to the `echo` command to enable interpretation of backslash escapes.

If after making these revisions the error still persists, your JSON input may be malformed or `jq` might be parsing it incorrectly. Double-check your input and consider running a JSON validator alongside your script to pinpoint possible issues.

**Prompt:**
jq: parse error: Invalid numeric literal at line 1, column 35

**Response:**
The issue you are facing suggests that the JSON parsing is encountering an error due to an invalid numeric literal. The error message points to a column that might provide a clue to what part of your JSON input or `jq` command is incorrect.

Check the part of your JSON input around column 35. The JSON specification requires that numbers cannot start with a leading zero unless the number is zero itself or it is a part of decimal fraction. For example, `0.5` or `0.01` are valid, but `01` or `05` are not valid.

The error may also come from a malformed command in `jq`. Ensure that your filters or operations that specifically deal with numbers are correctly formed.

If you have recently made changes to your JSON input or the `jq` code, you may want to revert those changes one by one to identify the cause of the error.

Lastly, using an online JSON validator tool can be a quick way of identifying issues with your JSON input. You can copy and paste your JSON input to such a tool to validate it.

**Prompt:**
can you look at what i gave you earlier

**Response:**
I apologize for misunderstanding your earlier request. Looking at the JSON input you posted earlier, it appears to already be well-formatted, and I didn't see any incorrect numeric literals. Here is a simpler version of your script which should function identically:

```bash
#!/bin/bash

# Read the JSON and prettify it using jq
json=$(jq '.')

# Extract the required fields from the JSON
id=$(echo $json | jq -r '.id')
prompt=$(echo $json | jq -r '.prompt')
content=$(echo $json | jq -r '.response_json.content')
role=$(echo $json | jq -r '.response_json.role')
model=$(echo $json | jq -r '.response_json.model')
created=$(echo $json | jq -r '.response_json.created')
datetime_utc=$(echo $json | jq -r '.datetime_utc')
conversation_name=$(echo $json | jq -r '.conversation_name')

# Generate the GitHub Markdown issue
issue_text="**Prompt:** $prompt\n**Content:** $content\n**Role:** $role\n**Model:** $model\n**Created:** $created\n**Datetime UTC:** $datetime_utc\n**Conversation Name:** $conversation_name"

# Print the Markdown issue
echo "$issue_text"
```

This script reads the JSON from standard input, which is more performance-efficient and dependable when handling large amounts of input. However, if your error continues, it is likely the issue lies with the command you're providing that generates the JSON rather than with the script itself.
