**Prompt:**
Unknown shorthand flag: 'R' in -R

**Response:**
I apologize for the error. It seems that the `-R` flag is not valid in the `gh repo view` command. Please use the following command to check the size of a GitHub repository using `gh cli`:

```bash
gh api repos/<repo_owner>/<repo_name> --jq ".size"
```

Alternatively, if you prefer to use `curl`, you can use the following command:

```bash
curl -s https://api.github.com/repos/<repo_owner>/<repo_name> | jq ".size"
```

Please note that you'll need to have `jq` installed for both options in order to extract the size information from the JSON response.
