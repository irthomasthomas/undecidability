**Prompt:**
Help me debug why kde plasma on manjaro linux is crashing on startuup

**Response:**
There could be several reasons why KDE Plasma is crashing on startup. Here are some steps you can follow to help debug and resolve the issue:

1. Check system requirements: Ensure that your Manjaro Linux installation meets the system requirements for KDE Plasma. Insufficient hardware resources can sometimes cause crashes during startup.

2. Update your system: Make sure that your Manjaro system is up to date with the latest software updates. Open a terminal and run the following commands:
   ```
   sudo pacman -Syu
   sudo reboot
   ```

3. Remove KDE configuration files: Sometimes corrupted configuration files can cause issues with KDE Plasma. Open a terminal and run the following commands to remove the KDE configuration files:
   ```
   mv ~/.kde4 ~/.kde4_backup
   mv ~/.config/plasma* ~/.config/plasma_backup
   ```

4. Check system logs: Start KDE Plasma and then check the system logs for any error messages. Open a terminal and run the following command to view the logs:
   ```
   journalctl -b -p3
   ```

   Look for any relevant error messages related to KDE Plasma. This can provide you with valuable information about the cause of the crash.

5. Disable desktop effects: Desktop effects can sometimes cause instability in KDE Plasma. Try disabling them temporarily to see if it resolves the issue. Open the System Settings, go to "Desktop Behavior" or "Workspace Behavior," and disable desktop effects.

6. Test with a new user account: Create a new user account and log in with it to test if KDE Plasma still crashes. If it works fine with the new user account, it indicates that the issue may be related to your user configuration files.

7. Reinstall KDE Plasma: If the above steps do not resolve the issue, you can try reinstalling KDE Plasma. Open a terminal and run the following command:
   ```
   sudo pacman -S plasma-desktop
   ```

   After the reinstallation is complete, reboot your system and check if the problem is resolved.

If none of these steps solve the problem, consider seeking help from Manjaro or KDE Plasma support forums or communities, as they may have more specific advice or troubleshooting steps for your specific issue.
