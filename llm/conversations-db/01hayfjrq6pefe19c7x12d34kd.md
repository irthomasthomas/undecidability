for i in `seq -w 1 5`;
do
useradd -g guixbuild -G guixbuild \
        -d /var/empty -s `which nologin` \
        -c "Guix build user $i" --system \
        guixbuilder$i;
done
useradd: Permission denied.
useradd: cannot lock /etc/group; try again later.

**Response:**
The error message "Permission denied" suggests that you don't have sufficient privileges to execute the `useradd` command. To use the `useradd` command, you need to have root privileges or be a user with the appropriate permissions.

If you have root access, you can run the script again with the `sudo` command to execute it as the superuser:

```bash
sudo bash script.sh
```

If you don't have root access, you will need to contact your system administrator and request the necessary permissions to create users or use the `useradd` command.
