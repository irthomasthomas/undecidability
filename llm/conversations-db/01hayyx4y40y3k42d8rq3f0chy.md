-Here is a refactoring of your script with a single ffmpeg process being paused and unpaused. There are several ways to approach the task of pausing and resuming a process on a KDE activity switch and the method outlined may not meet your specific use case. Also, Error handling and expected edge-cases handling might require further modifications and improvements.
-
-```bash
-#!/bin/bash
-
-# Declarating the variable to check the current activity
-currentActivity=$(qdbus org.kde.ActivityManager /ActivityManager/Activities CurrentActivity)
-
-# Store original ffmpeg pid in a file for reference
-ffmpeg -video_size 1024x768 -framerate 25 -f x11grab -i :0.0+100,200 -f alsa -i hw:0 output.mkv & echo $! > /tmp/ffmpeg_$currentActivity.pid
-
-while true; do
-  # Get the currently active KDE activity
-  newActivity=$(qdbus org.kde.ActivityManager /ActivityManager/Activities CurrentActivity)
-      
-  # Compare it with the old activity
-  if [[ "$newActivity" != "$currentActivity" ]]; then
-    # If the activities are different, pause the old recording and resume/start the new recording
-    
-    # Send stop signal to the ffmpeg process of the old activity
-    kill -STOP $(cat /tmp/ffmpeg_$currentActivity.pid)
-
-    # Check if the new activity already has a recording
-    if [[ -e "/tmp/ffmpeg_$newActivity.pid" ]]; then
-      # If it does, resume it
-      kill -CONT $(cat /tmp/ffmpeg_$newActivity.pid)
-    else
-      # Else, start a new recording for it
-      ffmpeg -video_size 1024x768 -framerate 25 -f x11grab -i :0.0+100,200 -f alsa -i hw:0 output_$newActivity.mkv & echo $! > /tmp/ffmpeg_$newActivity.pid
-    fi
-
-    # Update the recorded last activity
-    currentActivity=$newActivity
-
-  fi
-
-  # Sleep for 2 seconds before checking again - this prevents excessively frequent checks, but can be adjusted to user's needs
-  sleep 2
