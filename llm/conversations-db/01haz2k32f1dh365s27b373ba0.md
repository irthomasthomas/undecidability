**Prompt:**
Can I access that from host and vm at same time?

**Response:**
No, you cannot access the mounted disk image file from both the host and virtual machine (VM) at the same time. When a disk image file is mounted, it becomes exclusively accessible to the system that has mounted it. If you need to share data between the host and the VM, you may consider using shared folders or network file sharing methods instead.
