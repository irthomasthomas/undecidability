**Prompt:**
setgid?

**Response:**
The setgid (set group ID) permission is a special permission on a directory in Unix-like operating systems. When the setgid permission is set on a directory, any new files or subdirectories created within that directory inherit the group ownership of the parent directory. In other words, it ensures that any new files or directories created in the /home/tommy directory will have the group ownership as "tommy".
