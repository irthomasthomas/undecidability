**Prompt:**
Error: Your samba installation appears to be broken. Error: /Load smb config files from /etc/samba/smb.conf
Error loading services./


**Response:**
It seems like there is an issue with your Samba installation. The error message suggests that there might be a problem with loading the Samba configuration file (/etc/samba/smb.conf) and loading the services.

To troubleshoot this issue, you can try the following steps:

1. Check if the smb.conf file exists in the specified location (/etc/samba/smb.conf). If it is missing, you may need to reinstall Samba or restore the configuration file from a backup.

2. Verify the syntax of your smb.conf file by running the following command:

   ```shell
   testparm -s
   ```

   This command will check the configuration file for any syntax errors or issues.

3. Restart the Samba service to see if it resolves the problem. Use the following command:

   ```shell
   sudo systemctl restart smbd
   ```

   This command will restart the Samba service on your system.

If these steps do not resolve the issue, it might be helpful to provide more details about the specific error message you encountered, any recent changes made to your system, and the version of Samba and Manjaro you are using. This can assist in providing more targeted troubleshooting steps.

:: removing samba breaks dependency 'samba' required by kdenetwork-filesharing

**Response:**
It appears that the KDE Plasma package `kdenetwork-filesharing` depends on `samba`, so removing `samba` directly could break the dependency chain and cause issues with your system.

To resolve this, you can try the following steps:

1. Update your system to ensure you have the latest package information:

   ```shell
   sudo pacman -Syu
   ```

2. Attempt to remove `kdenetwork-filesharing` first, which will also remove `samba` as a dependency:

   ```shell
   sudo pacman -Rns kdenetwork-filesharing
   ```

   Removing `kdenetwork-filesharing` should automatically remove the `samba` package without breaking any dependencies.

3. If you no longer need `kdenetwork-filesharing`, you can proceed with removing `samba`:

   ```shell
   sudo pacman -Rns samba
   ```

   If `kdenetwork-filesharing` was successfully removed in the previous step, you should be able to remove `samba` without encountering dependency issues.

However, I would recommend caution when removing packages that are dependencies of other important components. If you're unsure, it is often best to keep the package installed or seek further advice from the Manjaro or KDE Plasma communities for a more specific solution.
