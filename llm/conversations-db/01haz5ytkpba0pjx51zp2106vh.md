**Response:**
To enable user shares, you can try the following command:

sudo nano /etc/samba/smb.conf

Look for the line `usershare allow guests = no` and change it to `usershare allow guests = yes`.

Save and exit the file (press Ctrl+X, then press Y, and press Enter).

Then, restart the Samba service:

sudo systemctl restart smbd.service

After that, you should be able to create user shares.
