**Response:**
To retype a new SMB password and resolve the "NT_STATUS_LOGON_FAILURE" error, you can try the following steps:

1. Open a terminal.

2. Type the following command to initiate the password reset process:
```bash
smbpasswd -r <machine_name_or_ip_address> -U <username>
```
Replace `<machine_name_or_ip_address>` with the name or IP address of the machine you are trying to connect to, and `<username>` with the username for which you want to reset the password.

If the machine name or IP address is 127.0.0.1, you can try:
```bash
smbpasswd -r 127.0.0.1 -U <username>
```

3. You will be prompted to enter the new password. Type the new password and press Enter. You might need to confirm the password by typing it a second time.

Make sure to replace `<username>` with the actual username you want to reset the password for.

If you're still encountering the same error after attempting these steps, there might be an issue with the authentication or network configuration of the machine you are connecting to. It might be necessary to check the logs or seek further assistance to troubleshoot the problem.
