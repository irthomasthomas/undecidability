**Response:**
The error messages suggest that the script is trying to process a file with an `.m4a` extension while it is designed to work with `.wav` files. The script is using the `sox` command-line utility which does not support the `.m4a` format by default.

You can either convert your `.m4a` files to `.wav` before running the script or modify the script to handle `.m4a` files.

Here is an example of how you can convert your audio files from `.m4a` to `.wav` using `ffmpeg`:

```bash
for FILE in ./*.m4a
do
  FILENAME=$(basename "$FILE" .m4a)
  ffmpeg -i "$FILE" "$FILENAME.wav"
done
```

Remember to install `ffmpeg` if it's not already installed:

```bash
sudo apt-get install ffmpeg
```

If you would rather modify the script to handle `.m4a` files, you will need to replace all instances of `.wav` with `.m4a` and ensure that your version of `sox` supports the `.m4a` format.

You can check if `sox` supports `.m4a` by running the following command:

```bash
sox --help | grep m4a
```

If the output is empty, then `sox` does not support `.m4a`. You will need to compile `sox` from source with the necessary libraries to add support for `.m4a`. This can be quite involved, so it might be easier to convert your files to `.wav` as suggested above.

**Prompt:**
The file name are VID20220523220048.m4a.wav, I think it is stripping the .wav?

**Response:**
Ah, I understand now. When the basename command is used with ".wav" as the extension to strip, it will indeed remove the last ".wav" part, leaving you with filenames ending in ".m4a", which are not correct. 

If you are certain that all your files are actually .wav files and the appearing ".m4a" in the filename doesn't represent the true format of the files, you need to adjust the script as follows:

Change the line:
`FILENAME=$(basename "$FILE" .wav)`

to:

`FILENAME=$(basename "$FILE" | rev | cut -d"." -f2- | rev)`

The revised code will not just remove the last ".wav", but it will truncate everything after the first "." from the end, leaving you with the expected filename. 

Before you make this change, please make sure that your .wav files do not have any additional `.` (dots) in their names. This new change will also remove everything after the first `.` encountered from the end, which could lead to incorrect results if your filenames do have `.` within them. For example, if you have a file named `my.audio.file.wav`, by applying this modification, you'll end up with `my.audio` instead of `my.audio.file`.
