**Prompt:**
for file in *.m4a.wav; do mv "$file" "${file/.m4a/}"; done
 Using as few words as required. Explain the shell script:\n

**Response:**
This shell script renames all files in the current directory that have the extension ".m4a.wav". It removes the ".m4a" part from the file name and keeps the ".wav" part. The script uses a for loop to iterate over each file with the specified extension and uses the "mv" command to rename the file. The "${file/.m4a/}" syntax is used to remove the ".m4a" part from the file name.
