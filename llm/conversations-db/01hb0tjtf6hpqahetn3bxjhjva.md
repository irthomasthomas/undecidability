**Prompt:**
for file in *.m4a.wav; do mv "$file" "${file/.m4a/}"; done
 Using as few words as required. Explain the shell script:\n

**Response:**
This shell script renames all files with the extension ".m4a.wav" by removing the ".m4a" part from their names. It does this by iterating through all files in the current directory that match the pattern "*.m4a.wav". For each file, it uses the "mv" command to rename the file by replacing the ".m4a" part of the filename with an empty string.
