**Prompt:**
I have a collection of videos consisting of an MP4, an LRF, and an SRT file. I use the following command to rename them, however this will not work for the SRT files. How should those be handled?: \n'exiftool -r -ext dng -ext jpg -ext tif -ext mov -ext mp4 -ext lrf -ext raf -ext png "-FileName<CreateDate" -d %Y_%m_%d__%H_%M_%S%%-c.%%e . -fast && find . -type f -name "*.srt" -execdir sh -c 'mv "$0" "${0%.*}.srt"' {};' 

**Response:**
You are right, as the 'exiftool' command is used to extract metadata from media files and rename them accordingly. However, SRT files (subtitle files) do not contain any metadata, so this approach will not work with them.

Therefore, the solution would be to rename your SRT files with exactly the same name as your video files. 
First, make sure that for each video file, there's an SRT file in the same directory. Then execute the following command:
```
find . -type f -name "*.mp4" -exec sh -c 'b="${1%.*}"; if [ -e "${b}.srt" ]; then mv "${b}.srt" "${b}_new.srt"; fi' sh {} \;
```
This command will find all files with .mp4 extension and rename their corresponding .srt files by appending "_new" before the .srt extension. You can replace "_new" with any string you prefer.

If all you want is to simply rename the SRT files to the same name as the video files, then the previous command would do the job. However, if you would like to append the creation date to the SRT files same way as with your video files, then it can become trickier since the SRT files don't have the metadata. As an alternative, you might need to extract the creation date of the corresponding video files and append it to the SRT files, which would need a more complex script.

**Prompt:**
that find command did nothing

**Response:**
I apologize for the misunderstanding. To help you better, I need a better understanding of what specifically you are trying to accomplish. Are you wanting to rename the `.srt` files to be the same as the corresponding `.mp4` files or do you want to append an identical timestamp to both?

If all you are trying to do is rename your `.srt` files to match their corresponding `.mp4`, the following command should work:

```Bash
find . -type f -name '*.mp4' -exec sh -c 'echo mv "${1%.*}.srt" "${1%.*}_new.srt"' \;
```
**NOTE:** To do the renaming operation, REMOVE `echo`. `echo` is used to print the command to the terminal to ensure it is correct.

If you cannot get the desired results, could you please provide more details about directory structure and what exactly you would like to accomplish? This way, I could assist you more effectively.

**Prompt:**
Rename the mp4 according to its metadata, then rename the matching srt file with the date taken from the mp4

**Response:**
This can be done in two steps. After renaming the .mp4 files using `exiftool`, you can use another script to rename .srt files to match their corresponding .mp4 files. However, it is not a single-line command. Here is a simple bash script that should do the trick:

```bash
#!/bin/bash
shopt -s nullglob # If no files match the glob, no results will be returned
# Step 1: Rename mp4 files using exiftool
exiftool -ext mp4 '-FileName<CreateDate' -d %Y_%m_%d__%H_%M_%S%%-c.%%e .

# Step 2: For each .mp4 file, find a matching .srt file to rename
for mp4 in *.mp4
do
  mp4_base="${mp4%%.*}" # Trim the extension, leaving base name
  for srt in "$mp4_base".srt
  do
    # If corresponding srt file exists, rename it to match mp4 file.
    [ -e "$srt" ] && mv "$srt" "${mp4_base}.srt"
  done
done
```

This script first renames all .mp4 files based on their "CreateDate" metadata. Then, for each renamed .mp4 file found, it looks for a .srt file with the same base name. If it finds one, it renames the .srt file to match the .mp4 file.
