**Response:**
This script is used to rename media files in a directory. Here is a step-by-step breakdown of the script:

1. The first line "#!/bin/bash" is the shebang line, which indicates that the script should be interpreted by the bash shell.

2. The "shopt -s nullglob" line enables the nullglob option. This option makes sure that if no files match a glob (pattern) in the loop, no results will be returned. This prevents issues if there are no files with the ".MP4" extension in the directory.

3. The "for mp4 in *.MP4" loop iterates over all files with the ".MP4" extension in the current directory.

4. Inside the loop, the "exiftool" command is used to rename the mp4 files using the date of creation. The "-ext mp4" option specifies that only files with the ".mp4" extension should be renamed. The "-FileName<CreateDate" option tells exiftool to use the creation date of the file as the new file name. The "-d %Y_%m_%d__%H_%M_%S%%-c.%%e" option specifies the desired format of the new file name. The dot "." at the end specifies the current directory as the target directory for the renaming.

5. The "mp4_base" variable is assigned the base name of the mp4 file by removing the extension using the "${mp4%%.*}" syntax.

6. The inner "for" loop iterates over files with the same base name as the mp4 file but with the ".srt" extension. This loop is used to rename the corresponding srt file if it exists.

7. Inside the inner loop, the echo "$srt" command is used to print the name of the srt file.

8. The "[ -e "$srt" ]" conditional statement checks if the srt file exists. If the file exists, the "mv" command is used to rename the srt file to match the mp4 file.

9. The "${mp4_base}.srt" is the new file name for the srt file, where "${mp4_base}" is the base name of the mp4 file and ".srt" is the extension.

10. The loop continues to the next mp4 file in the directory, until all mp4 files have been processed.

**Prompt:**
Fix the problem mentioned.

**Response:**
To fix the problem mentioned in the script, where the variable `mp4_base` still contains the original name after renaming the mp4 file, you can update the script as follows:

```bash
#!/bin/bash
# Rename media files in a dir.

shopt -s nullglob # If no files match the glob, no results will be returned

for mp4 in *.MP4
do
  # Renames mp4 files using exiftool
  exiftool -ext mp4 '-FileName<CreateDate' -d %Y_%m_%d__%H_%M_%S%%-c.%%e "$mp4"
  
  # Update the value of mp4_base after renaming the mp4 file
  mp4_base="${mp4%%.*}" # Trim the extension, leaving base name
  
  for srt in "$mp4_base".srt
  do
    # If corresponding srt file exists, rename it to match mp4 file.
    [ -e "$srt" ] && mv "$srt" "${mp4_base}.srt"
  done
done
```

In this updated version, the `exiftool` command is executed with the `"$mp4"` variable instead of using a dot (`.`) to specify the current directory. This ensures that the file is renamed correctly and the variable `mp4_base` will contain the updated file name.

By making this change, the script should now properly rename the mp4 files and also rename the corresponding srt files if they exist.
