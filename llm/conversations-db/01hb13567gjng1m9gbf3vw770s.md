done \n man exiftool has this info that may be instructive: 
       -srcfile FMT
            Specify  a  different  source  file  to  be  processed based on the name of the original FILE.  This may be useful in some
            special situations for processing related preview images or sidecar files.  See the -w option for a description of the FMT
            syntax.  Note that file name FMT strings for all options are based on the original FILE specified from the  command  line,
            not the name of the source file specified by -srcfile.

            For  example,  to copy metadata from NEF files to the corresponding JPG previews in a directory where other JPG images may
            exist:

                exiftool -ext nef -tagsfromfile @ -srcfile %d%f.jpg dir

            If more than one -srcfile option is specified, the files are tested in  order  and  the  first  existing  source  file  is
            processed.  If none of the source files already exist, then exiftool uses the first -srcfile specified.

            A  FMT  of  "@"  may be used to represent the original FILE, which may be useful when specifying multiple -srcfile options
            (eg. to fall back to processing the original FILE if no sidecar exists).

            When this option is used, two special UserParam tags (OriginalFileName  and  OriginalDirectory)  are  generated  to  allow
            access to the original FILE name and directory.

**Response:**
The script you have written will rename all the .MP4 files in the current directory based on their CreateDate metadata. It will also attempt to rename any .srt files with the same base name as the .MP4 files to match the new .MP4 file names.

However, there is an issue with your script. The variable $mp4_base is created before renaming the .MP4 file, so it holds the original .MP4 file name. Therefore, when you try to rename the .srt file, it will not find a match because the .MP4 file has already been renamed.

To fix this, you should create the $mp4_base variable after renaming the .MP4 file. Here's a corrected version of your script:

```bash
#!/bin/bash
# Rename media files in a dir.

shopt -s nullglob # If no files match the glob, no results will be returned

for mp4 in *.MP4
do
  # Renames mp4 files using exiftool
  exiftool -ext mp4 '-FileName<CreateDate' -d %Y_%m_%d__%H_%M_%S%%-c.%%e "$mp4"
  
  # Get the new name of the mp4 file
  new_mp4=$(exiftool -s3 -filename "$mp4")
  mp4_base="${new_mp4%%.*}" # Trim the extension, leaving base name
  
  for srt in "$mp4_base".srt
  do
    # If corresponding srt file exists, rename it to match mp4 file.
    echo "$srt"
    [ -e "$srt" ] && mv "$srt" "${mp4_base}.srt"
  done
done
```

This script will get the new name of the .MP4 file after it has been renamed and then use that to rename the corresponding .srt file.
