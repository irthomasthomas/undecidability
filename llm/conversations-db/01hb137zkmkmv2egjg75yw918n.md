done \n the exiftool man page has this info that may be instructive: 
       -srcfile FMT
            Specify  a  different  source  file  to  be  processed based on the name of the original FILE.  This may be useful in some
            special situations for processing related preview images or sidecar files.  See the -w option for a description of the FMT
            syntax.  Note that file name FMT strings for all options are based on the original FILE specified from the  command  line,
            not the name of the source file specified by -srcfile.

            For  example,  to copy metadata from NEF files to the corresponding JPG previews in a directory where other JPG images may
            exist:

                exiftool -ext nef -tagsfromfile @ -srcfile %d%f.jpg dir

            If more than one -srcfile option is specified, the files are tested in  order  and  the  first  existing  source  file  is
            processed.  If none of the source files already exist, then exiftool uses the first -srcfile specified.

            A  FMT  of  "@"  may be used to represent the original FILE, which may be useful when specifying multiple -srcfile options
            (eg. to fall back to processing the original FILE if no sidecar exists).

            When this option is used, two special UserParam tags (OriginalFileName  and  OriginalDirectory)  are  generated  to  allow
            access to the original FILE name and directory.

**Response:**
The script you provided renames mp4 files in a directory based on their creation date using exiftool. However, it fails to rename corresponding srt files because the variable `mp4` still contains the original name after the mp4 file is renamed.

To fix this issue, you can use the `-srcfile` option of exiftool to specify a different source file to be processed based on the name of the original file. Here's an updated version of your script:

```bash
#!/bin/bash
# Rename media files in a dir.

shopt -s nullglob # If no files match the glob, no results will be returned

for mp4 in *.MP4
do
  # Renames mp4 files using exiftool
  exiftool -ext mp4 -srcfile '@' '-FileName<CreateDate' -d %Y_%m_%d__%H_%M_%S%%-c.%%e "$mp4"
  # Problem is that we have now renamed the mp4, but the variable contains the original name, so the lrf won't be renamed.
  # If we rename it before the loop, then the names wont match and the lrf still will not be renamed.
  mp4_base="${mp4%%.*}" # Trim the extension, leaving base name
  for srt in "$mp4_base".srt
  do
    # If corresponding srt file exists, rename it to match mp4 file.
    echo "$srt"
    [ -e "$srt" ] && mv "$srt" "${mp4_base}.srt"
  done
done
```

In this updated script, I added the `-srcfile '@'` option to the exiftool command. This option tells exiftool to use the original FILE specified on the command line as the source file for processing. Now, when the mp4 file is renamed, the variable `mp4` will still contain the original name, allowing you to rename the corresponding srt file correctly.
