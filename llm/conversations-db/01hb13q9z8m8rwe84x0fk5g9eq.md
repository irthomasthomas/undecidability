**Response:**
This script is designed to rename media files in a directory. It first sets the nullglob option, which means that if no files match the glob pattern, no results will be returned.

It then loops through all the MP4 files in the directory and renames them using the exiftool command. The new file name is based on the file's creation date and time, in the format YYYY_MM_DD__HH_MM_SS. The extension is preserved.

After renaming the MP4 file, the script checks if there is a corresponding SRT file with the same base name. If such a file exists, it is renamed to match the new MP4 file name.

In the example output you provided, there is a warning about the ExtractEmbedded option potentially finding more tags in the media data. This is followed by an error indicating that the file DJI_0294.MP4 was not found.

The script should be run with the command "sh /home/tommy/Development/media-renamer.sh" in the terminal.
