**Prompt:**
Think carefully. Write an algorithm first. I want to use sox in bash to identify sections of an audio file that contain long periods of significant noise, and play that section of audio. Let's reason it through carefully. And lets keep our chat succint and concise. Thanks.

**Response:**
Algorithm:

1. Accept the path to the audio file as input.
2. Use the `sox` command in Bash to convert the audio file into a mono, 16-bit, 44.1 kHz format (if necessary).

   Command: `sox <input_file> -c 1 -b 16 -r 44100 <output_file>`

3. Use the `sox` command to split the audio file into smaller sections, analyzing each section separately for significant noise.

   Command: `sox <input_file> <output_file> trim <start_position> <duration> noiseprof <noise_profile> remix 1`
   
   - `<start_position>` is the position (in seconds) within the audio file to start the analysis.
   - `<duration>` is the length (in seconds) of each section to analyze.
   - `<noise_profile>` is a generated noise profile file used for noise detection and removal.

4. Create an empty array `significant_sections` to store the start and end positions of sections identified as having significant noise.

5. Set a minimum threshold (e.g., -30 dB) to define what is considered as significant noise.

6. Iterate through each section file generated in step 3.

   1. Use the `sox` command to analyze the noise level of the section file.

      Command: `sox <section_file> -n stat -q`

   2. Extract the peak amplitude value from the output of the analysis and compare it to the threshold.

   3. If the noise level exceeds the threshold, append the start and end positions of the section to the `significant_sections` array.

7. If the `significant_sections` array is empty, output a message indicating there were no significant noise sections found in the audio file and terminate.

8. Otherwise, iterate through the `significant_sections` array.

   1. Use the `sox` command to play the identified section of audio.

      Command: `play <input_file> trim <start_position> <duration>`

   2. Repeat step 8.1 for each section in the array.

9. Output a message indicating the playback of significant noise sections has finished.

End of the algorithm.
