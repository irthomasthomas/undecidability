**Prompt:**
check logs on manjaro terminal

**Response:**
To check logs on the Manjaro terminal, you can follow these steps:

1. Open the terminal by pressing `Ctrl + Alt + T` or searching for "Terminal" in the system menu.

2. Once the terminal is open, you can use various commands to view logs.

- To view system logs, you can use the `journalctl` command. For example, to view the entire system log, enter `journalctl -b`.

- To view specific logs for a service or application, you can use the `journalctl -u <service-name>` command. Replace `<service-name>` with the name of the service or application you want to retrieve logs for.

- To view logs in real-time as they are generated, you can use the `journalctl -f` command.

- To search for specific keywords or filter logs by specific criteria, you can use the `journalctl --grep="<keyword>"` command. Replace `<keyword>` with the word or phrase you want to search for.

3. After executing the desired command, you will see logs displayed in the terminal. You can scroll up and down to view them.

Keep in mind that some log files may require administrative privileges to access, so you may need to prefix commands with `sudo` and provide your password when prompted.
