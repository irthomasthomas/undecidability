**Prompt:**
I have ssh working. Now how do I rdp through it?

**Response:**
Using SSH to remote desktop (RDP) into another machine involves creating an SSH tunnel from your local machine to the remote machine and then connecting your remote desktop client to this tunnel. Here is how you can do it:

1. **Create an SSH Tunnel**

First, you need to create an SSH tunnel. Open a new terminal window on your local machine and type in the following command:

```bash
ssh -L 3390:localhost:3389 username@remote_ip_address
```

Replace "username" with your username on the remote machine, and "remote_ip_address" with the remote machine's IP address.

In the command, `-L` specifies that the connections from the client are to be forwarded to the server, 3390 is the source port (and can be anything), localhost is the destination, and 3389 is the destination port.

Press Enter to run the command and it will prompt you for a password.

The SSH tunnel has been created and is ready to use.

2. **Remote Desktop To SSH Tunnel**

Next, we will connect a remote desktop client to the SSH tunnel.

- On Linux: You can use Remmina, rdesktop, or Vinagre. The basic syntax to connect would be:
    ```
    rdesktop localhost:3390
    ```
- On Mac: You can use Microsoft RDP client. In the Server field, you would put `localhost:3390`.

- For Windows: You can use Microsoft Remote Desktop. Type `localhost:3390` into the computer field.

You’ll be immediately connected to your remote Windows desktop.

> Please, have in mind you still need a correctly configured RDP server at the destination. If the RDP server is not set up properly, you will not be able to connect via RDP.

**Prompt:**
how to check if rdp is enabled? remmina says cannot connect to localhost

**Response:**
If you're receiving an error such as "Unable to connect to LOCALHOST" through Remmina, it might indicate that the remote system doesn't have RDP (Remote Desktop Protocol) enabled, or a network issue is present. 

Here's how to check if RDP is enabled on a remote system:

**On Windows:**

1. Press `Win + R`, then write `sysdm.cpl` and hit `Enter`.

2. System properties open, go to the `Remote` tab.

3. In the `Remote Desktop` section, you should see the settings related to RDP. If `Allow remote connections to this computer` is enabled, then RDP is enabled.

**On Linux**

Ensure that you've installed an RDP server, like `xrdp`. You can check if the service is running using the following command in the terminal:

```bash
sudo systemctl status xrdp
```

You should see `running` in the output if it's enabled.

**On macOS**

1. Open `System Preferences`.

2. Go to `Sharing`.

3. Check if `Remote Management` or `Screen Sharing` is on.

Remember to check your server's firewall settings. If the server has a running firewall, RDP connections might need to be allowed there too.

**Response:**
Great! The log you posted shows that `xrdp` service is running (`Active: active (running)`) on your Linux machine, which means RDP is enabled. This service is listening on port `3389`, which is the default RDP port.

If you're still having trouble connecting via Remmina, here are some additional troubleshooting steps:

1. **Firewall settings**: Check if a firewall is active and is possibly blocking the RDP port. If `firewalld` or `iptables` is active, you may need to allow traffic through port 3389.

2. **Security groups/Network ACLs**: If your Linux machine is on a cloud service like AWS, make sure your security groups or Network ACLs allow incoming connections to port 3389.

3. **Correct credentials**: Ensure you're entering the right credentials (username/password) of the Linux machine.

4. **Connection settings**: When setting up the connection in Remmina, ensure you're using the right protocol (RDP) and entering the right IP address of the Linux machine. Since you have the SSH tunnel, make sure Remmina is connecting to `localhost` on the forwarded port (e.g., 3390).

5. **RDP client logs**: If the connection is still not successful, check the logs of your RDP client (Remmina). It can further provide clues as to why the connection is being rejected.

Remember, when connecting through RDP using the SSH tunnel, you should point Remmina (or any other RDP client) to your **localhost** (or 127.0.0.1) and **not** the IP of your remote machine. This is because SSH is creating a tunnel from your local machine to the remote one, so the RDP protocol is, effectively, being sourced from your local machine. Use the port you mapped on your local machine in SSH tunnel command as the port in Remmina (based on your previous example, this would be 3390).
