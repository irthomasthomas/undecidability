**Prompt:**
I connect via ssh port 2202. do i need to change xrdp?'


**Response:**
No, you do not need to change xrdp if you are connecting via SSH port 2202. xrdp is a separate remote desktop protocol that allows you to connect to a remote desktop environment. SSH and xrdp serve different purposes and use different ports. As long as your SSH connection is working fine on port 2202, you can continue to use xrdp as it is without any need for changes.

**Prompt:**
connection refused

**Response:**
If you are receiving a "connection refused" error when trying to connect to xrdp, it indicates that there is an issue with the xrdp service or port configuration. Here are a few steps you can take to troubleshoot the problem:

1. Verify that the xrdp service is running: Check the status of the xrdp service using the command `sudo service xrdp status`. If it is not running, start the xrdp service using `sudo service xrdp start`.

2. Ensure that the xrdp port is open: Confirm that the port used by xrdp (default is 3389) is open on your server's firewall. You can check the status of your firewall and allow the xrdp port using appropriate commands for your firewall configuration. For example, if you are using UFW, the command would be `sudo ufw allow 3389`.

3. Check for any errors in the xrdp logs: Review the xrdp logs for any error messages that may help diagnose the issue. The log file is typically located at `/var/log/xrdp.log`. Use the command `sudo tail -f /var/log/xrdp.log` to view the latest entries in real-time.

4. Verify the xrdp configuration: Ensure that the xrdp configuration is correctly set up. The configuration file is usually located at `/etc/xrdp/xrdp.ini`. You can check the configuration file and make any necessary adjustments using a text editor or the command line.

If the issue persists, it may be helpful to provide more details about your specific setup, such as your operating system and any relevant error messages, to receive more targeted assistance.
