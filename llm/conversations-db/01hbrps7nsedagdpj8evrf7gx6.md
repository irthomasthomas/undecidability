**Prompt:**
view ssl logs arch linux

**Response:**
To view SSL logs on Arch Linux, you can follow these steps:

1. Open a terminal on your Arch Linux system.

2. Install the `rsyslog` package if it is not already installed by running the following command:
```
sudo pacman -S rsyslog
```

3. Once the installation is complete, you need to enable the `rsyslog` service by running the following command:
```
sudo systemctl enable rsyslog
```

4. Start the `rsyslog` service by running:
```
sudo systemctl start rsyslog
```

5. By default, SSL related logs are stored in the `/var/log/secure` file. To view the SSL logs, you can use a text editor such as `less` or `cat`. For example, to view the logs in the terminal, run the following command:
```
sudo cat /var/log/secure
```

Alternatively, you can use the `journalctl` command to view the logs in a more structured and searchable format. To view SSL logs with `journalctl`, use the following command:
```
sudo journalctl _SYSTEMD_UNIT=rsyslog.service _COMM=openssl
```

These steps will help you view SSL logs on your Arch Linux system.
