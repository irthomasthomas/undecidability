**Prompt:**
view ssh logs arch linux

**Response:**
SSH logs in Arch Linux can typically be viewed using the `journalctl` command, which is used for querying and displaying messages from the systemd journal. SSH uses the system logging service to document its activities, which is managed by systemd on Arch Linux.

Here is the command to view SSH logs:

```bash
sudo journalctl _SYSTEMD_UNIT=sshd.service
```
Here is the command to view real-time follow logs:

```bash
sudo journalctl _SYSTEMD_UNIT=sshd.service -f
```

This will display the entire log file from the service specified. If you want to see just the recent entries you can use the `-n` option:

```bash
sudo journalctl _SYSTEMD_UNIT=sshd.service -n
```

For a specific time period you can use the `--since` and `--until` options. For example, to display logs from yesterday:

```bash
sudo journalctl _SYSTEMD_UNIT=sshd.service --since yesterday
```

Or a range of time:

```bash
sudo journalctl _SYSTEMD_UNIT=sshd.service --since "2022-01-01" --until "2022-02-01"
```

It might be necessary to replace "sshd.service" with "ssh.service" depending on your configuration.

Running these commands will provide any logs related to SSH. Remember to replace `sshd.service` with the name of your SSH service if it's different.
