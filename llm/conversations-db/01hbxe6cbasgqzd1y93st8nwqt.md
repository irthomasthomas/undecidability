Apologies for the incorrect suggestion. In Manjaro Linux, the wastebasket directory for root is `/root/.local/share/Trash`, so the correct command to restore files deleted with sudo privileges is:

```bash
sudo trash-restore /root/.local/share/Trash/files/*
```

I apologize for the confusion. It seems that the trash utility installed on your system is not recognizing the files deleted by sudo. In that case, you can manually restore the files from the trash directory. 

The wastebasket directory for root is `/root/.local/share/Trash/files`. You can navigate to this directory and use the `mv` command to move the files back to their original location. 

Here's an example command to restore files deleted by sudo:

```bash
sudo mv /root/.local/share/Trash/files/* /path/to/restore/location/
```

Make sure to replace `/path/to/restore/location/` with the actual path where you want to restore the files.
