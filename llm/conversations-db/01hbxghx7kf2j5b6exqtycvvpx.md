**Prompt:**
Manjaro/Arch linux error: Failed to restart smdb.service: Unit smdb.service not found.

**Response:**
The error message "Failed to restart smdb.service: Unit smdb.service not found" usually appears when you try to restart the "smdb.service" service but it is either not installed or not recognized by the system.

To resolve this issue, you can follow these steps:

1. Double-check the service name: The error message indicates that the system could not find the "smdb.service" unit. Make sure you have not misspelled the service name, or verify if it’s the correct service name for your system. You can use the `systemctl list-unit-files` command to get a list of all available unit files.

2. Install the required package: If the “smdb.service” is part of a package, you may need to install that package first. Check the package manager's documentation (like pacman or yay) for the correct package name and install it using the appropriate command, e.g., `sudo pacman -S package_name`.

3. Verify the service configuration: If you have confirmed that the service is installed correctly, but the system still cannot find it, there might be a problem with the service configuration file. Open the service file using a text editor, e.g., `sudo nano /etc/systemd/system/smdb.service`, and ensure that the file is properly configured with the correct unit name, paths, and commands.

4. Restart the service manually: If all else fails, you can try manually starting the service using the command `sudo systemctl start smdb.service` instead of relying on the restart functionality. Note that this will only work if the service is correctly installed and recognized by the system.

By following these steps, you should be able to address the “Unit smdb.service not found” error and properly restart the service.
