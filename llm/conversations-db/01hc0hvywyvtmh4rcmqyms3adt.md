**Prompt:**
Some of the files are named like: HYPERLAPSE_0181-HYPERPIECE-2022_10_03__07_20_01, write a function dedicated to handling those in the same way, and move your prior code to its own function.

**Response:**
# Define a function to extract the first part of the file name before the first "-"
extract_first_part() {
  local file=$1
  basename "$file" | cut -d '-' -f 1
}

# Define a function to handle files with or without file extensions
handle_files() {
  local file=$1
  local file_name=$(extract_first_part "$file")
  # Add commands to handle the file_name as desired
}

# Example usage: handle_files HYPERLAPSE_0180-HYPERPIECE-2022_10_03__07_19_57.DNG
# This will call the extract_first_part function and assign the result to the variable file_name
# You can then further process file_name as needed
