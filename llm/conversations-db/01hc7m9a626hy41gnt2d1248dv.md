**Prompt:**
what is the difference between the cpu scaling_governors on linux?

**Response:**
On Linux systems, CPU scaling governors are responsible for regulating the CPU frequency and thus managing the performance and power consumption of the CPU. Here are the main scaling governors and their differences:

1. Performance Governor: This governor sets the CPU frequency to the maximum value at all times, ensuring maximum performance. It does not take power management into account and will consume more energy.

2. Powersave Governor: On the opposite end, the powersave governor sets the CPU frequency to the lowest value to minimize power consumption. It sacrifices performance for energy efficiency.

3. Ondemand Governor: The ondemand governor dynamically scales the CPU frequency in response to the workload. It adjusts the frequency based on the CPU load. Under low load, it reduces the frequency to save power, while increasing it under high load to maintain performance.

4. Conservative Governor: Similar to the ondemand governor, the conservative governor scales the CPU frequency based on demand. However, it changes the frequency more gradually, avoiding unnecessary abrupt frequency changes.

5. Userspace Governor: This governor allows external programs or scripts to specify the desired CPU frequency. It grants more flexibility to user-defined power management policies.

6. Interactive Governor: The interactive governor is an enhanced version of the ondemand governor. It dynamically scales the CPU frequency with more responsive behavior, reducing frequency faster in response to low load and increasing it more rapidly under high load.

It's important to note that the availability of these governors may vary depending on the Linux Kernel version and configuration.

**Prompt:**
which is schedutil?

**Response:**
schedutil is a CPU scaling governor introduced in the Linux kernel version 4.7. It is designed to provide an improved dynamic frequency scaling algorithm compared to the existing governors. The schedutil governor aims to balance performance and power consumption by making frequency scaling decisions based on the CPU's utilization and the scheduling behavior of tasks.

Unlike other governors that rely solely on CPU load, schedutil utilizes the scheduler's utilization tracking infrastructure to estimate the CPU utilization accurately. It takes into account factors like task wakeup rates, sleep states, and other scheduler metrics to make more informed frequency scaling decisions.

schedutil governor dynamically adjusts the CPU frequency in response to workload changes, favoring the lowest frequency that still meets the performance requirements. It reduces the frequency more slowly during low load and ramps it up faster during high load compared to governors like ondemand or conservative. This behavior allows for faster response times and more efficient power management.

schedutil is considered a more responsive and efficient governor in terms of performance and power savings compared to some of the older governors. However, its effectiveness may vary depending on specific use cases and system configurations.
