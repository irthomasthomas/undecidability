**Prompt:**
what a cpv function?

**Response:**
CPV stands for Cost-Per-View, which is an advertising model used in online marketing campaigns, particularly in video advertising. In CPV, advertisers pay a predetermined amount for each view of their video ad. The view is typically counted when the video ad is played for a specific duration or when a user actively engages with the video by clicking on it or taking a specified action. This model allows advertisers to track and control their costs more effectively and measure the success of their campaigns based on the number of views generated.
