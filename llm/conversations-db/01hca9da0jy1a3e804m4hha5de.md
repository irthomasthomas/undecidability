**Response:**
I'm sorry, I made a mistake in my previous response. To check which GPU driver is in use, you can use the "lsmod" command to list all loaded kernel modules and then grep for the driver related to the GPU. Here's the correct command:

lsmod | grep "drm"

0b:00.0 VGA compatible controller: NVIDIA Corporation GA106 [GeForce RTX 3060 Lite Hash Rate] (rev a1)
        Subsystem: NVIDIA Corporation GA106 [GeForce RTX 3060 Lite Hash Rate]
        Kernel driver in use: nvidia

**Response:**
From the output you provided, it seems that you have two GPUs installed. The first GPU is a NVIDIA GeForce GTX 1080 and the second GPU is a NVIDIA GeForce RTX 3060 Lite Hash Rate.

The kernel driver in use for the GeForce GTX 1080 is "nvidia" and the kernel driver in use for the GeForce RTX 3060 Lite Hash Rate is also "nvidia".

Please note that the "nouveau" driver is also listed in the kernel modules but it is not currently in use for either of the GPUs.

**Prompt:**
whats the diff between nvidia and nvidia_drm?

**Response:**
The "nvidia" and "nvidia_drm" kernel modules serve different purposes in relation to NVIDIA GPUs.

The "nvidia" module is the actual NVIDIA graphics driver. It provides the necessary software components for the GPU to function, including hardware acceleration, power management, and other features specific to NVIDIA GPUs. This module is responsible for communicating with the GPU and enabling it to work with the Linux operating system.

On the other hand, the "nvidia_drm" module is a part of the DRM (Direct Rendering Manager) subsystem, which is a component of the Linux kernel responsible for managing access to the GPU. The "nvidia_drm" module provides the DRM kernel driver for NVIDIA GPUs. It allows for direct rendering and provides the necessary interfaces for applications to interact with the GPU, such as OpenGL.

In summary, the "nvidia" module is the main graphics driver responsible for the functionality of the GPU, while the "nvidia_drm" module is related to the DRM subsystem and provides the necessary kernel-level functionality for GPU access and rendering.
