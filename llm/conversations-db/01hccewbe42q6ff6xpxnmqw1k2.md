**Prompt:**
Create a string in lisp

**Response:**
Here's an example of creating a string in Lisp using the standard `format` function:

```lisp
(format nil "Hello, Lisp!") ; "Hello, Lisp!"
```

In this example, `(format nil ...)` is used to create a string without specifying a destination (i.e., `nil` is used as the destination), and `"Hello, Lisp!"` is the content of the string.

**Prompt:**
Can you fix this function so that the title and url are copied as a single string: 
(define-command copy-title-and-url ()
  "Save current page title and url to clipboard."
  (copy-to-clipboard (title (current-buffer),(render-url (url (current-buffer)))))
  (echo "~a copied to clipboard." (title (current-buffer),(render-url (url (current-buffer)))))

**Response:**
Certainly! Here's the corrected version of the function:

```lisp
(define-command copy-title-and-url ()
  "Save current page title and url to clipboard."
  (let* ((current-buffer (current-buffer))
         (current-title (title current-buffer))
         (current-url (url current-buffer))
         (title-and-url (format nil "~a ~a" current-title current-url)))
    (copy-to-clipboard title-and-url)
    (echo "~a copied to clipboard." title-and-url)))
```

In this corrected version, I have used the `let*` form to bind the variables `current-buffer`, `current-title`, and `current-url` to their respective values. Then, I have created a new variable `title-and-url` by concatenating the `current-title` and `current-url` using the `format` function. Finally, the `title-and-url` string is copied to the clipboard and echoed as the output message.
