**Prompt:**
go ahead

**Response:**
This shell script opens the Yakuake terminal emulator with a very large window size of 9999x9999 pixels and positions it at the top-left corner of the screen. This may result in the terminal window being larger than your screen, making it difficult to view or interact with. To make it fit better, you can adjust the window size to a smaller value that suits your screen resolution. For example, you can try using a window size like 800x600 or 1024x768 for better visibility.

**Prompt:**
write a command that makes yakuake take one quarter of the screen

**Response:**
To make Yakuake take one quarter of the screen, you can use the following command:
```
yakuake --mainwindowgeometry=50%x50%
```
This will set the main window of Yakuake to occupy 50% of the screen's width and 50% of the screen's height, effectively dividing the screen into quarters. Adjust the values as needed to fit your screen size and preference.
