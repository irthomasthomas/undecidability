**Prompt:**
I'd like to be able to take the selected text and pipe it to the system
so instead of select+copy+paste+pipe
you do select+pipe pipe-selection cat - | cut -f 1 > /tmp/bla.txt
in the background it'll just do something like cat stuff | sh -c "[pipeline]"
 Using as few words as required. Explain this shell script to a linux expert:\n

**Response:**
This shell script allows you to take the selected text and pipe it to the system. Instead of manually copying and pasting the selected text, you can simply select the text and use the pipe symbol (|) to pass it to the script. 

The script itself consists of a pipeline that takes the selected text as input and performs some operations on it. In this example, the selected text is piped to the "cat" command, which outputs the text. Then, the output is piped to the "cut" command with the "-f 1" option, which extracts the first field from each line of the input. Finally, the result is redirected to a file named "/tmp/bla.txt" using the ">" symbol.

The script is designed to be run in the background, meaning it will execute without any user interaction. The selected text is automatically passed to the script and processed accordingly.

**Prompt:**
what is sh -c "[pipeline]"

**Response:**
In the given context, "sh -c '[pipeline]'" refers to a command that runs a shell interpreter (usually "sh") and executes a specific pipeline of commands enclosed in single quotes.

The "[pipeline]" represents the series of commands or operations you want to execute. In the previous explanation, it was referred to as "cat stuff | cut -f 1 > /tmp/bla.txt". So, by using "sh -c", you are invoking the shell interpreter and instructing it to run the specified pipeline as a command.

The "sh" command is a common choice for invoking a shell interpreter, but you could use a different shell if desired (e.g., "bash -c", "zsh -c", etc.). The "-c" flag is used to indicate that the following argument is the command to be executed.
