**Prompt:**
and the curl flags?

**Response:**
The `curl` flags used in the command are as follows:

- `-f` or `--fail`: This flag prevents `curl` from outputting error messages and failing silently in case the download fails.
- `-s` or `--silent`: This flag makes `curl` silent, suppressing the progress meter and any other additional output.
- `-S` or `--show-error`: This flag, when used with `-s`, makes `curl` display an error message if the download fails.
- `-L` or `--location`: This flag instructs `curl` to follow any redirect URLs and download from the final location.

**Prompt:**
how do I initialise and access named pipes?

**Response:**
To initialize and access named pipes in Linux, you can follow these steps:

1. Initializing a named pipe:
   ```
   mkfifo <pipe_name>
   ```
   Replace `<pipe_name>` with the desired name for the pipe. This command creates a named pipe file with the specified name.

2. To write data into the named pipe, you can use redirection or other command output:
   ```
   echo "Data" > <pipe_name>
   ```
   Replace `"Data"` with the content you want to write into the pipe. The `>` symbol redirects the output to the named pipe.

3. To read data from the named pipe, you can use the `cat` command:
   ```
   cat <pipe_name>
   ```
   This command reads and displays the contents of the named pipe.

Remember that reading from a named pipe will block until there is data available in the pipe. Writing to a named pipe will also block if no process is currently reading from it.

Named pipes provide a way for inter-process communication where one process writes data to the pipe, and another process reads from it. Multiple processes can read and write to the same named pipe for communication.
