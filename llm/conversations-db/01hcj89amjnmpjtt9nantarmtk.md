**Prompt:**
I have two paths for guix /usr/local/bin/guix
/home/thomas/.config/guix/current/bin/guix
why is that? it should be pointing to the one in my config, the second path. The default path contains out of date version

**Response:**
There could be a few reasons why the default path (/usr/local/bin/guix) may still exist and contain an outdated version of Guix. Here are a few possibilities to consider:

1. System wide installation: The /usr/local/bin/guix path might be from a system-wide installation of Guix. This could have been installed through a package manager or manually compiled and installed.

2. Previous installation: It's possible that you had a previous installation of Guix that was put into the default path. This could have been installed before you set up the current version in your config.

3. Environment variable: Another possibility is the existence of an environment variable that points to the default path. The variable might be set in a system-wide configuration file or in your user's environment.

To ensure that your desired version is being used, you can modify your PATH environment variable to prioritize the second path. You can do this by adding the following line to your shell's startup file (e.g., ~/.bashrc or ~/.zshrc):

```
export PATH="/home/thomas/.config/guix/current/bin:${PATH}"
```

Once you've made this change, open a new terminal session, and the second path should take precedence over the default one.

**Prompt:**
How do I remove the old guix?

**Response:**
To remove the old Guix installation located at `/usr/local/bin/guix`, you can follow these steps:

1. Identify the files associated with the old Guix installation by running the following command:

   ```
   which -a guix
   ```

   This will show you the location(s) of the Guix executable(s) on your system.

2. Verify that the identified paths belong to the old Guix installation and not any important system files.

3. Once you are certain that you want to remove the old Guix installation, you can use the `sudo` command to remove the files. For example, if the path is `/usr/local/bin/guix`, you can run:

   ```
   sudo rm /usr/local/bin/guix
   ```

   Repeat this command for every path identified in step 1.

Keep in mind that removing software from your system can have consequences, so make sure you fully understand the implications of removing a package before doing so. It's always a good idea to have a backup of important data and configurations.
