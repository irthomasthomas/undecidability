**Prompt:**
command not found: bind

**Response:**
I apologize for the confusion. The `bind` command is actually a built-in command of the Bash shell. It seems that you are using a different shell where the `bind` command is not available.

To check the keybinding of `^[[A`, you can use the `read` command with the `-s` (silent) and `-N` (number of characters to read) options:

```bash
read -s -N 3 key && echo -n "$key"
```

When you press the keys `Ctrl` + `[` + `A`, it will display the escape sequence corresponding to `^[[A`.
