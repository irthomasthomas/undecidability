**Prompt:**
sed -i s/robbyrussell/agnoster/g ~/.zshrc
 Using as few words as required. Explain this shell script to a linux expert:\n

**Response:**
This shell script uses the `sed` command to replace the string "robbyrussell" with "agnoster" in the file `~/.zshrc`. The `-i` option is used to edit the file in-place, meaning the changes will be made directly to the file rather than printing the modified output to the terminal.
