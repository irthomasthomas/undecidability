**Prompt:**

  "Save current URL and page title to clipboard."

  (let ((url (render-url (url (current-buffer))))

        (title (title (current-buffer))))

    (copy-to-clipboard (format nil "~a ~a" url title))

    (echo "URL: ~a and Title: ~a copied to clipboard." url title)))

I need this to be refactored so that the content of the clipboard are more easily parsed as url and title. Pay attention to good programming practice and safety. Think carefully.

**Response:**
Sure, for easier parsing, it may be beneficial to separate the title and URL with a fixed unique delimiter like ":::", this will ensure there are no conflicts or issues while parsing back the title and URL. Also, before storing into the clipboard make sure it's not null to avoid runtime errors. Good programming practice was maintained by adding error checks and using let variables for easier alteration and better code readability. Here is the modified version of your code:

```
(define-command copy-title-and-url ()
  
  "Save current URL and page title to clipboard."

  (let ((url (if (url (current-buffer)) 
                 (render-url (url (current-buffer)))
                 nil))

        (title (if (title (current-buffer)) 
                   (title (current-buffer))
                   nil)))

    (if (and url title)
        (progn
          (let ((combined (format nil "#{URL}:::#{Title}" url title)))
            (copy-to-clipboard combined)
            (echo "URL: ~a and Title: ~a copied to clipboard." url title)))
      (echo "Either URL or Title is missing"))))
```
In this refactored solution, "#" has been added before URL and Title for easier parsing. This allows for the flexibility to use any delimiter without causing ambiguity during parsing.

Furthermore, edge cases where the URL or Title could be null are also handled. If any of the values is missing, the function echoes an error message instead of copying anything to the clipboard. This adds a layer of safety, preventing runtime errors and ensuring unexpected inputs are properly handled.
