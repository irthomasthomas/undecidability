I need this to be refactored so that the content of the clipboard are more easily parsed as url and title. Pay attention to good programming practice and safety. Think carefully.

**Response:**
Sure, the potential issue with the current format is that there's no clear delimiter between the URL and the title, especially if the title itself contains spaces. To make it more easily parsed, we can use a unique delimiter like `\n` (newline), or even the markdown format where the title would be in brackets `[]` and the url would be in parenthesis `()`.

Also, in the `let` statement, you're calling `(url (current-buffer))` and `(title (current-buffer))` before checking whether they're `nil`, which could potentially throw an error in some environments (if the current buffer doesn't have a valid title or URL). Let's refactor this to account for these possibilities as well.

Here's the refactored code, using the newline delimiter:

```lisp
(define-command copy-title-and-url ()
  "Save current URL and page title to clipboard."
  (let* ((buffer (current-buffer))
         (url (and buffer (render-url (url buffer))))
         (title (and buffer (title buffer))))
    (when (and url title)
      (let ((formatted-string (format nil "~a\n~a" url title))) 
        (copy-to-clipboard formatted-string)
        (echo "URL and Title copied to clipboard. URL: ~a Title: ~a" url title)))))
```

The checking for `nil` values in `url` and `title` provides more safety, and using `\n` as a delimiter between url and title allows them to be more easily parsed (url is always on the first line, and title on the second). 

Also, I used `(let* .. )` instead of `(let .. )` to allow for sequential bindings where later bindings can refer to earlier ones. This can provide more clarity than nested `let` forms.

Use markdown

**Response:**
Sure! Here's the refactored code using the markdown format for the clipboard content:

```lisp
(define-command copy-title-and-url ()
  "Save current URL and page title to clipboard."
  (let* ((buffer (current-buffer))
         (url (and buffer (render-url (url buffer))))
         (title (and buffer (title buffer))))
    (when (and url title)
      (let ((formatted-string (format nil "[%a](%a)" title url))) 
        (copy-to-clipboard formatted-string)
        (echo "URL and Title copied to clipboard. URL: %a, Title: %a" url title)))))
```

In this version, the clipboard content will be formatted in markdown style: `[Page Title](Page URL)`. The URL will be enclosed in parentheses `()` and the title will be enclosed in brackets `[]`, making it easily parsable in markdown parsing tools.

**Response:**
My apologies for the confusion. You are correct, let's use `~a` instead of `%a` within the `format` function call. Here's the corrected code:

```lisp
(define-command copy-title-and-url ()
   "Save current URL and page title to clipboard."
   (let* ((buffer (current-buffer))
      (url (and buffer (render-url (url buffer))))
      (title (and buffer (title buffer))))
     (when (and url title)
       (let ((formatted-string (format nil "[~a](~a)" title url))) 
         (copy-to-clipboard formatted-string)
         (echo "URL and Title copied to clipboard. URL: ~a, Title: ~a" url title)))))

```
In this version, `~a` is used to insert the 'title' and 'url' into the formatted string instead of `%a`.
