**Prompt:**
How can I read that programmatically? e.g. if I want to submit an issue with gh issue new --title (title from [title]) --body (url from [url]

**Response:**
You can assign the output of the sed command to variables and then use them in a subsequent command. Here's an example:

```bash
# Assigning the output to variables
output=$(echo "[title](url)" | sed -n 's/.*\[\([^]]*\)\](\([^)]*\))/title=\1\nurl=\2/p')

# Extracting title and url values from the output
eval "$output"

# Submitting an issue using the extracted variables
gh issue new --title "$title" --body "$url"
```

Make sure you have the `gh` command-line tool installed and authenticated with your GitHub account.

**Prompt:**
I am generating the title url from nyxt browser like below. Perhaps there is an easier way to do this. \n (define-command copy-title-and-url ()
   "Save current URL and page title to clipboard."
   (let* ((buffer (current-buffer))
      (url (and buffer (render-url (url buffer))))
      (title (and buffer (title buffer))))
     (when (and url title)
       (let ((formatted-string (format nil "[~a](~a)" title url))) 
         (copy-to-clipboard formatted-string)
         (echo "URL and Title copied to clipboard. URL: ~a, Title: ~a" url title)))))

**Response:**
Based on your code snippet, it seems like you're using Nyxt browser to generate the title and URL. Instead of copying them to the clipboard and then extracting them from there programmatically, you can directly retrieve the values within your script. Here's an updated version of your code:

```bash
#!/bin/bash

# Save current URL and page title to variables
url=$(nyxt -e "(print (render-url (url (current-buffer))))")
title=$(nyxt -e "(print (current-page-title))")

# Submitting an issue using the extracted variables
gh issue new --title "$title" --body "$url"
```

Make sure you have the `nyxt` command-line tool and `gh` command-line tool installed before running this script.

echo $(nyxt -r -e "(print (title (current-buffer)))" -q)                                                                   ✔

        Using the fallback 'C' locale.
Gtk-Message: 20:46:19.875: Failed to load module "xapp-gtk3-module"

<INFO> [20:46:19] Probing remote instance listening to /run/user/1000/nyxt/nyxt.socket.

**Response:**
The warning messages and the `<INFO>` message you received are normal and do not affect the command's functionality. They are related to Gtk settings and Nyxt's connection probing.

Instead of using command substitution `$()` in the `echo` command, you can directly use the `-o` argument of Nyxt to output the result. It will look like this:

```bash
nyxt -r -e "(print (title (current-buffer)))" -q -o
```

This will output only the title string without any additional messages.
