**Prompt:**
nyxt(define-command copy-title-and-url ()                                         1 ✘ 
   "Save current URL and page title to clipboard."
   (let* ((buffer (current-buffer))
      (url (and buffer (render-url (url buffer))))
      (title (and buffer (title buffer))))
     (when (and url title)
       (let ((formatted-string (format nil "[~a](~a)" title url))) 
         (copy-to-clipboard formatted-string)
         (echo "URL and Title copied to clipboard. URL: ~a, Title: ~a" url title))))) 

It seems like you're using Nyxt browser to generate the title and URL. Instead of copying them to the clipboard and then extracting them from there programmatically, you can directly retrieve the values within your script. Here's an updated version of your code:

**Response:**
 ​

( define-command copy-title-and-url ()
    "Store the current title and URL under the variables `title` and `url` respectively."
    ( let ((buffer (current-buffer))
          (url (and buffer (render-url (url buffer))))
          (title (and buffer (title buffer))))
      ( when (and url title)
        ;; Here we are storing the title and url within our Lisp process under
        ;; the variables `title` and `url`. The variables can be
        ;; accessed at any time until the next `copy-title-and-url` command is executed.
        (setf (get 'title 'value) title
              (get 'url 'value) url )
        (echo "URL and title saved. URL: ~a, title: ~a." url title)))) ​

; Now we execute the command to retrieve the title and URL.
(copy-title-and-url)

; And now we can retrieve the values of the `title` and `url` variables.
(get 'title 'value) ; Value:  "Example Title" 
(get 'url 'value)  ; Value: "https://www.example.com" 

With this approach, we can easily access and use the values of the title and URL without having to rely on the clipboard. This can be particularly useful if you want to use the values in further commands or functions.
