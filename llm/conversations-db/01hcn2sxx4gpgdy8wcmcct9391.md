**Prompt:**
nyxt(define-command copy-title-and-url ()
   "Save current URL and page title to clipboard."
   (let* ((buffer (current-buffer))
      (url (and buffer (render-url (url buffer))))
      (title (and buffer (title buffer))))
     (when (and url title)
       (let ((formatted-string (format nil "[~a](~a)" title url))) 
         (copy-to-clipboard formatted-string)
         (echo "URL and Title copied to clipboard. URL: ~a, Title: ~a" url title))))) 

Based on your code snippet, it seems like you're using Nyxt browser to generate the title and URL. Instead of copying them to the clipboard and then extracting them from there programmatically, you can directly retrieve the values within a bash script. Here's an updated version of your code:

```bash
#!/bin/bash

# Save current URL and page title to variables

# Submitting an issue using the extracted variables

**Response:**
# Extract URL and Title using Nyxt and store them in variables
URL=$(nyxt -e "render-url (nyxt:current-buffer)")
TITLE=$(nyxt -e "title (nyxt:current-buffer)")

# Print URL and Title for verification
echo "URL: $URL"
echo "Title: $TITLE"

# Use the extracted URL and Title to submit an issue
# ...

# Let the user know the URL and Title have been copied
echo "URL and Title copied to variables."
```

In this updated code, we use the `nyxt` command-line tool and the `-e` option to run Lisp code within Nyxt. We retrieve the URL and Title using the `render-url` and `title` functions respectively and store them in Bash variables. You can then use these variables for further processing, like submitting an issue.
