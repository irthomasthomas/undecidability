**Prompt:**
IS THERE A WAY TO MAKE THIS LISP MORE READABLE? (define-command-global pipe-selection-title-url ()
  (let* ((title (title (current-buffer)))
         (url (url (current-buffer)))
         (selection (ps-eval (ps:chain window (get-selection) (to-string))))
         (formatted-output (format nil "~a~%~a~%~a" title url selection)))
    (uiop:launch-program (list "sh" "-c" (concatenate 'string "echo " "'" formatted-output "'" " > /tmp/nyxt_selection_pipe"))))) Think it through carefully. Dont change the variable names.

**Response:**
Yes, there are several ways to make this Lisp code more readable. Here are some suggestions:

1. Use meaningful variable names: Instead of using single-letter variable names like `url`, `title`, and `selection`, consider using more descriptive names that indicate their purpose and content.

2. Split long expressions into multiple lines: Break the `(let* ...)` statement into multiple lines to enhance readability. Align the nested expressions to make the code structure clearer.

3. Indentation: Indent the code properly to show the hierarchy of expressions and their relationships.

4. Use comments: Add comments to explain the purpose and functionality of each section or specific code block.

Taking these suggestions into account, here's a modified version of the code with improved readability:

```lisp
(define-command-global pipe-selection-title-url ()
  ;; Get the title of the current buffer
  (let* ((title (title (current-buffer)))

         ;; Get the URL of the current buffer
         (url (url (current-buffer)))

         ;; Get the selected text
         (selection (ps-eval (ps:chain window (get-selection) (to-string)))

         ;; Format the output string
         (formatted-output (format nil "~a~%~a~%~a" title url selection)))

    ;; Launch a shell command to write the formatted output to a file
    (uiop:launch-program (list "sh" "-c"
                               (concatenate 'string
                                            "echo "
                                            "'" formatted-output "'"
                                            " > /tmp/nyxt_selection_pipe")))))
```

By following these guidelines, the code becomes more readable and easier to understand.
