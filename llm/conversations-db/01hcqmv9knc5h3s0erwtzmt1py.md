**Prompt:**
IS THERE A WAY TO MAKE THIS LISP MORE READABLE? (define-command-global pipe-selection-title-url ()
  (let* ((title (title (current-buffer)))
         (url (url (current-buffer)))
         (selection (ps-eval (ps:chain window (get-selection) (to-string))))
         (formatted-output (format nil "~a~%~a~%~a" title url selection)))
    (uiop:launch-program (list "sh" "-c" (concatenate 'string "echo " "'" formatted-output "'" " > /tmp/nyxt_selection_pipe"))))) Think it through carefully. Dont change the variable names.

**Response:**
To make this Lisp code more readable, you can follow these suggestions:

1. Use meaningful variable names: While you shouldn't change the given variable names, in real code, it's always good practice to use descriptive variable names. This helps in understanding the purpose and content of each variable.

2. Break down complex expressions: Rather than having one long expression to define `formatted-output`, you can break it down into smaller steps with meaningful names. This will make the code easier to read and understand. For example, you can create separate variables for the formatted `title`, `url`, and `selection`.

3. Indentation and spacing: Properly indent and add spacing to improve code readability. Indenting the code consistently and adding appropriate line breaks can enhance the visual structure and make the code easier to follow.

Here's a possible updated version of the code with these suggestions:

```lisp
(define-command-global pipe-selection-title-url ()
  (let* ((title (title (current-buffer)))
         (url (url (current-buffer)))
         (selection (ps-eval (ps:chain window (get-selection) (to-string))))
         (formatted-output
           (format nil "~a~%~a~%~a" title url selection)))
    (uiop:launch-program 
      (list "sh" "-c" 
            (concatenate 'string 
                         "echo "
                         "'" formatted-output "'"
                         " > /tmp/nyxt_selection_pipe")))))
```

By following these suggestions, you can significantly improve the readability of the code.
