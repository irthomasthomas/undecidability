**Prompt:**
#!/bin/bash
pipe_file="/tmp/nyxt_pipe"
mkfifo "$pipe_file"  # Create a named pipe
nyxt -r -e "(with-open-file (stream \"$pipe_file\" :direction :output :if-exists :supersede) (print (url (current-buffer))))" -q
trap "rm -f $pipe_file" EXIT  # Ensure the pipe file is removed when the script exits
url=$(cat "$pipe_file")  # Read the URL from the named pipe and store it in a variable
echo "The URL is: $url"

**Response:**
This script allows you to fetch the URL of the current buffer in the Nyxt browser.

Here's how it works:

- It first creates a named pipe at `/tmp/nyxt_pipe`. A named pipe is a special kind of file that acts as a FIFO channel for communication between processes.

- The `nyxt -r -e` command then launches Nyxt, asks it to evaluate a piece of Common Lisp code and then quit. Specifically, the code opens the named pipe file for output, retrieves the URL of the current buffer in Nyxt, and writes it into the pipe.

- The `trap` command ensures that, no matter how the script terminates, the named pipe file gets removed.

- Finally, the script reads from the named pipe into a variable named `url`, and prints this URL.

In summary, by integrating the Nyxt browser with Bash via a named pipe, the script extracts the current browser URL.

Note: The Nyxt browser must be already running for the `nyxt -r -e` command to work. If it's not, the command has nothing to connect to and nothing to evaluate its code against, and it'll fail.
