**Prompt:**
Write a bash terminal command to How do I accept input from stdin in my bash script? Be concise, but include as much code as needed. Do not write anything else. Ever.


**Response:**
To accept input from stdin in a bash script, you can use the `read` command. Here's an example:

```bash
#!/bin/bash

# Prompt the user to enter their name
echo "Please enter your name:"

# Read the input from stdin and store it in a variable
read name

# Print a greeting with the entered name
echo "Hello, $name!"
```

Save the above code in a file, let's say `script.sh`. Make the file executable using the `chmod` command:

```bash
chmod +x script.sh
```

Then you can run the script and provide input from stdin:

```bash
./script.sh
```

The script will prompt you to enter your name, and after you provide the input, it will print a greeting with the entered name.
