**Prompt:**
Write a bash terminal command to How do I accept piped input in my bash script? Be concise, but include as much code as needed. Do not write anything else. Ever.


**Response:**
To accept piped input in a bash script, you can use the `read` command with the `-r` option to read the input from the standard input. Here's an example:

```bash
#!/bin/bash

while read -r line; do
    # Process each line of input here
    echo "Input: $line"
done
```

You can save the above code in a bash script file, for example `script.sh`, and then you can pipe input into it like this:

```bash
$ cat input.txt | ./script.sh
```

In this example, `input.txt` contains the input that you want to process. Each line of the input will be read and processed inside the `while` loop of the script.

**Prompt:**
how to reconstruct the object from the lines?

**Response:**
To reconstruct an object from lines of input in a bash script, you can use the `echo` command to print the lines as output, and then use command substitution to capture the output as a variable.

Here's an example:

```bash
#!/bin/bash

read -r line1
read -r line2
read -r line3

# Reconstruct the object
reconstructed_object="{\"property1\": \"$line1\", \"property2\": \"$line2\", \"property3\": \"$line3\"}"

# Display the reconstructed object
echo "$reconstructed_object"
```

In this example, the script reads three lines of input using the `read` command. The lines are then used to reconstruct the object by setting the respective properties. The reconstructed object is then printed using the `echo` command.

You can save the above code in a bash script file, for example `script.sh`, and then you can pipe your input into it like this:

```bash
$ cat input.txt | ./script.sh
```

Replace `input.txt` with the actual file containing the lines you want to use to reconstruct the object. The reconstructed object will be printed as the script's output.
