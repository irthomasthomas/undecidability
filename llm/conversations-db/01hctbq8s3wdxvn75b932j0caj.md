2023-10-15 20:06:01 Debug command: tdrop -n Default - TopLeft -x 0% -y 0% --width=48% --height=48% --post-map-hook wmctrl -r 'konsole - Drop Down - Default - TopLeft' -b add,sticky konsole --class=Default - TopLeft --title konsole - Drop Down - Default - TopLeft
konsole: Unknown option 'class'.

**Response:**
The command you provided seems to have an error. The issue is with the `--class` option in the `konsole` command. The correct option should be `-e` to specify the command to execute in the terminal. Here's the corrected command:

```
tdrop -n "Default - TopLeft" -x 0% -y 0% --width=48% --height=48% --post-map-hook "wmctrl -r 'konsole - Drop Down - Default - TopLeft' -b add,sticky" konsole -e "bash -c 'echo Hello; exec bash'" --title "konsole - Drop Down - Default - TopLeft"
```

This command will open a Konsole terminal with the specified title and execute the `echo Hello` command. You can replace `echo Hello` with any other command you want to run in the terminal.

**Prompt:**
the konsole does not seem to be respecting the height

**Response:**
I apologize for that. It seems that the `--height` option may not be working as expected with the `tdrop` command. You can try an alternative approach by using `xdotool` to resize the terminal after it has been launched. Here's an updated command:

```
tdrop -n "Default - TopLeft" -x 0% -y 0% --width=48% konsole --title "konsole - Drop Down - Default - TopLeft" && sleep 1 && xdotool search --title "konsole - Drop Down - Default - TopLeft" windowsize --sync 0% 48%
```

This command will launch a Konsole terminal with the specified title and then use `xdotool` to resize the window to the desired height. Adjust the `--width` and `--height` options as needed to achieve the desired size. The `sleep 1` command is included to give the terminal some time to fully launch before resizing.

Please note that you may need to install `xdotool` if it's not already installed on your system. You can typically do this through your package manager.

**Prompt:**
No good. Problem is it is not setting the title

**Response:**
Apologies for the confusion. If the `--title` option is not working as expected, you can try using the `--name` option instead. Here's an updated command:

```
tdrop -n "Default - TopLeft" -x 0% -y 0% --width=48% konsole --name "konsole - Drop Down - Default - TopLeft" && sleep 1 && xdotool search --name "konsole - Drop Down - Default - TopLeft" windowsize --sync 0% 48%
```

This command uses `--name` instead of `--title` in both the `tdrop` and `xdotool` commands. Adjust the `--width` and `--height` options as needed.

If the issue persists, it could be that the version of `konsole` you are using does not support setting the name. In that case, you might consider using another terminal emulator that supports this functionality.

**Prompt:**
rewrite my original command for kitty

**Response:**
Certainly! Here's the rewritten command for the `kitty` terminal emulator:

```
tdrop -n "Default - TopLeft" -x 0% -y 0% --width=48% kitty --name "konsole - Drop Down - Default - TopLeft" && sleep 1 && xdotool search --name "konsole - Drop Down - Default - TopLeft" windowsize --sync 0% 48%
```

This command will launch the `kitty` terminal with the specified name and then use `xdotool` to resize the window to the desired height. Adjust the `--width` and `--height` options as needed. Remember to have `xdotool` installed on your system.

Make sure you have `kitty` installed and configured properly for this command to work as expected. Refer to the `kitty` documentation for more information on its usage and configuration.

**Prompt:**
replace konsole with kitty

**Response:**
Apologies for the confusion. Here's the updated command to use `kitty` instead of `konsole`:

```
tdrop -n "Default - TopLeft" -x 0% -y 0% --width=48% --height=48% --post-map-hook "wmctrl -r 'kitty - Drop Down - Default - TopLeft' -b add,sticky" kitty --name "kitty - Drop Down - Default - TopLeft"
```

This command will launch `kitty` with the specified name and dimensions, and then use `wmctrl` to make the window sticky. Adjust the `--width` and `--height` options as desired.

Please note that you may need to have `wmctrl` and `kitty` installed on your system for this command to work properly. Adjust the `--post-map-hook` command if you have a different approach for making the window sticky.

Ensure that you have the correct name for the `kitty` window and adjust it accordingly.
