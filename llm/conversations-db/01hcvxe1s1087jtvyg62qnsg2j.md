**Prompt:**
what is the difference between an algorithm and a design pattern in software?

**Response:**
An algorithm is a step-by-step procedure or a set of rules to be followed in order to solve a specific problem or complete a task. It is a specific solution approach that provides a sequence of instructions for carrying out a particular computational task. Algorithms can be implemented in any programming language.

On the other hand, a design pattern is a general reusable solution to a commonly occurring problem within a given context in software design. It is a higher-level concept that provides a template for solving a specific design problem. Design patterns are not language-specific and can be implemented using different programming languages.

In essence, an algorithm focuses on solving a specific computational problem, defining the exact steps to be taken, while a design pattern focuses on providing a general solution approach for recurring design problems encountered during software development.
