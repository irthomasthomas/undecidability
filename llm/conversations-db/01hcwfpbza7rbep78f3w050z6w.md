**Prompt:**
unmap and activate windowid in xdotool

**Response:**
In xdotool, the "unmap" command is used to unmap a window, which means that it will be hidden from the screen. The syntax for unmap is:

```
xdotool windowunmap <windowid>
```

Here, `<windowid>` refers to the ID of the window that you want to unmap.

On the other hand, the "activate" command is used to activate/focus a window, bringing it to the front. The syntax for activate is:

```
xdotool windowactivate <windowid>
```

Similarly, `<windowid>` refers to the ID of the window that you want to activate.

To get the window ID of a specific window, you can use the "search" command in xdotool. Here is an example:

```
xdotool search --name "Window Name"
```

Replace "Window Name" with the desired window's name, and xdotool will return its corresponding window ID.

You can combine these commands to unmap and activate windows as needed, using their respective window IDs.
