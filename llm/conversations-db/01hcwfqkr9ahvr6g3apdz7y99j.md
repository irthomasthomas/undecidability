**Prompt:**
map and activate windowid in xdotool

**Response:**
In xdotool, you can use the "search" command to find the window ID of a specific window and then use the "windowactivate" command to activate the window.

Here's an example of how you can use xdotool to map and activate a window ID:

1. Open a terminal and type the following command to get a list of all open windows along with their IDs:
```
xdotool search --onlyvisible --name "window_name"
```
Replace "window_name" with the actual name or title of the window you want to map and activate. This command will show the window ID of all visible windows with the given name.

2. Once you have the window ID, you can activate the window by executing the following command:
```
xdotool windowactivate window_id
```
Replace "window_id" with the actual ID of the window you want to activate.

For example, if the window ID is 12345, you would use the following command to activate the window:
```
xdotool windowactivate 12345
```

Keep in mind that window IDs may change each time you launch a program, so you may need to update the ID in the command accordingly.
