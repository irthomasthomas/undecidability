**Prompt:**
xdotool search --class "jetbrains-fleet" --name "StreamDeck"  
xdotool: Unknown command: --name

**Response:**
The command xdotool does not have an argument "--name" for searching by name. The correct way to search by class and name is as follows:

```
xdotool search --class "jetbrains-fleet" search --name "StreamDeck"
```

This command will search for windows with the class "jetbrains-fleet" and the name "StreamDeck".

**Prompt:**
I want to activate the jetbrains-fleet class that contains streamdeck in its name

**Response:**
Apologies for the confusion. To activate the window with the class "jetbrains-fleet" that contains "StreamDeck" in its name, you can use the following xdotool command:

```
xdotool search --class "jetbrains-fleet" search --name ".*StreamDeck.*" windowactivate
```

**Prompt:**
the search returns too many window ids

**Response:**
If the search command returns multiple window IDs, you can loop through them and activate each window one by one. Here's an example:

```bash
#!/bin/bash

window_ids=$(xdotool search --class "jetbrains-fleet" search --name ".*StreamDeck.*")

for window_id in $window_ids; do
    xdotool windowactivate $window_id
    sleep 0.5  # Adjust the sleep duration if needed
done
```

This script will activate each window that matches the specified class and contains "StreamDeck" in its name. Adjust the sleep duration between window activations if you encounter any issues.

**Prompt:**
how about limiting the search to normal windows?

**Response:**
To limit the search to normal windows, you can use the `--onlyvisible` option with the `search` command. Here's an updated version of the script:

```bash
#!/bin/bash

window_ids=$(xdotool search --onlyvisible --class "jetbrains-fleet" search --name ".*StreamDeck.*")

for window_id in $window_ids; do
    xdotool windowactivate $window_id
    sleep 0.5  # Adjust the sleep duration if needed
done
```

By adding the `--onlyvisible` option, the search will only return visible (normal) windows with the specified class and name pattern.

**Prompt:**
that finds both windows with class "jetbrains-fleet" OR with name "StreamDeck". Meaning some windows of the wrong class are returned"


**Response:**
I apologize for the oversight. To filter the search results based on both class and name, you can use the `getwindowname` and `getwindowclassname` commands along with `if` conditions. Here's an updated version of the script:

```bash
#!/bin/bash

# Get the list of window IDs
window_ids=$(xdotool search --onlyvisible --class "jetbrains-fleet")

for window_id in $window_ids; do
    # Get the class and name of the current window
    window_class=$(xdotool getwindowclassname $window_id)
    window_name=$(xdotool getwindowname $window_id)
    
    # Check if the class and name match the desired criteria
    if [[ $window_class == *"jetbrains-fleet"* ]] && [[ $window_name == *"StreamDeck"* ]]; then
        xdotool windowactivate $window_id
        sleep 0.5  # Adjust the sleep duration if needed
    fi
done
```

This script will filter the search results to only activate the windows that match both the specified class "jetbrains-fleet" and contain "StreamDeck" in their name.
