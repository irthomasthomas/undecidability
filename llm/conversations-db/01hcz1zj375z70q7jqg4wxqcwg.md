**Response:**
The variable `$window_pid` is always empty because the line `$window_pid="$(cat $tmp_dir/fleet-$project.pid)"` is assigning an empty value to it. 

This is because the PID file `fleet-undecidability.pid` does not exist in the specified directory `/tmp/streamdeck_windows`. The error message `touch: cannot touch '/tmp/streamdeck_windows/fleet-undecidability.pid': No such file or directory` indicates that the directory `/tmp/streamdeck_windows` does not exist.

Since the PID file is not created, the subsequent `cat` command to retrieve the PID fails with the error `cat: /tmp/streamdeck_windows/fleet-undecidability.pid: No such file or directory`. Therefore, the variable `$window_pid` remains empty.

To fix this issue, you need to ensure that the directory `/tmp/streamdeck_windows` exists before attempting to create or access files within it.

**Prompt:**
fix it

**Response:**
To fix the issue, you can modify the script to create the directory `/tmp/streamdeck_windows` if it doesn't exist before using it. Here's the modified script:

```bash
#!/bin/bash

# Should match the project's dir name e.g. $HOME/Projects/undecidability
project="undecidability"

# streamdeck.service removes /tmp/streamdeck-windows at startup.
tmp_dir="/tmp/streamdeck_windows"

# Create the directory if it doesn't exist
mkdir -p "$tmp_dir"

if [ ! -f "$tmp_dir/fleet-$project.pid" ]; then
    echo "opening fleet"
    fleet "$HOME/Projects/$project"
    touch "$tmp_dir/fleet-$project.pid"
    echo $! > "$tmp_dir/fleet-$project.pid"
    window_pid="$(cat $tmp_dir/fleet-$project.pid)"
    echo "window_pid = $window_pid"
    sleep 2
    wait "$window_pid" \
        && echo "$project window just exited" \
        && rm "$tmp_dir/fleet-$project.pid"
    exit
else
    window_ids=$(xdotool search --onlyvisible --class "jetbrains-fleet")
    for window_id in $window_ids; do
        # Get the class and name of the current window
        window_class=$(xdotool getwindowclassname $window_id)
        # We do this as we need to substring match $project & $window_name.
        window_name=$(xdotool getwindowname $window_id)
        # Check if the class and name match the desired criteria
        if [[ $window_class == *"jetbrains-fleet"* ]] && [[ $window_name == *"$search_string"* ]]; then
            echo "found window. Activating $window_id"
            xdotool windowactivate $window_id
            exit
        fi
    done
fi
```

With this modification, the script will create the `/tmp/streamdeck_windows` directory if it does not exist before trying to create the PID file `fleet-undecidability.pid`.
