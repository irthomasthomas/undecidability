OUTPUT:

cat pid file

window_pid =

**Response:**
Based on the given script, the variable `window_pid` is empty because the value of `$pid_file` is not being correctly read and assigned to it.

In the code snippet `window_pid="$(cat $pid_file)"`, the variable `$pid_file` is not enclosed in double quotes, so if the file path contains spaces or special characters, it can cause issues. It's recommended to enclose the variable in double quotes as follows:

```
window_pid="$(cat "$pid_file")"
```

This ensures that the file path is correctly interpreted, and the contents of the file are captured in the `window_pid` variable.
