OUTPUT:

touch /tmp/streamdeck_windows/fleet-undecidability.pid
cat pid file

window_pid = 
undecidability window just exited

**Response:**
The `$!` shell variable will contain the PID of the most recent background command. In your script, the command `fleet "$HOME/Projects/$project"` is run in the foreground, so it does not get a PID that can be captured by `$!`.

If you want to capture the PID of `fleet "$HOME/Projects/$project"`, you need to run it in the background by appending `&` at the end of the command. 

Change this line:

```bash
fleet "$HOME/Projects/$project"
```

to this:

```bash
fleet "$HOME/Projects/$project" &
```

So, the corrected portion of the script would be:

```bash
if [ ! -f "$pid_file" ]; then
    echo "opening fleet"
    fleet "$HOME/Projects/$project" &
    echo "touch $pid_file"
    touch "$pid_file"
    echo $! > "$pid_file"
    echo "cat pid file"
    cat "$pid_file"
    window_pid="$(cat "$pid_file")"
    echo "window_pid = $window_pid"
    sleep 2
    wait $window_pid \
        && echo "$project window just exited" \
        && rm "$pid_file"
    exit
fi
```
