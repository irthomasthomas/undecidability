**Prompt:**
yay -Rns package

**Response:**
The -Rns option is used with the package manager in some Linux distributions, such as pacman in Arch Linux, to remove a package along with its dependencies that are no longer required. So, when you use "yay -Rns package" in the command line, you are instructing the package manager to remove the specified package and its dependencies that are not needed by any other installed package. This helps to clean up your system and free up disk space.
