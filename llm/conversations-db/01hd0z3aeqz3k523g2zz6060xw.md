how to reinstall zsh and reset to defaults on arch

**Response:**
To reinstall Zsh and reset it to its default settings on Arch Linux, you can follow these steps:

1. Uninstall Zsh: Open a terminal and run the following command to remove the currently installed Zsh package:
```
sudo pacman -Rns zsh
```
This will remove the Zsh package along with its associated configuration files.

2. Delete Zsh configuration files: Run the following command to delete any remaining Zsh configuration files that might be present:
```
rm -rf ~/.z*
```
Please be cautious while running this command, as it will delete all files and directories starting with `.z` in your home directory.

3. Reinstall Zsh: Now, you can reinstall Zsh by running the following command in the terminal:
```
sudo pacman -S zsh
```
This will install the Zsh package from the Arch Linux repositories.

4. Set Zsh as the default shell: To set Zsh as your default shell, run the following command:
```
chsh -s /bin/zsh
```
You will need to enter your password for authentication. After successful authentication, your default shell will be set to Zsh.

5. Create a new default Zsh configuration: Zsh provides a convenient way to generate a default configuration file. Run the following command in the terminal:
```
zsh -f
```
This will launch Zsh with a minimal configuration, and it will output the default configuration file.

6. Create a new Zsh configuration file: Run the following command to create a new Zsh configuration file:
```
echo "source /etc/zsh/zshrc" > ~/.zshrc
```

7. Restart your terminal or log out and log back in for changes to take effect.

Now, Zsh will be reinstalled and restored to its default settings on your Arch Linux system.

**Response:**
It seems that there are some dependencies that prevent you from directly uninstalling Zsh. In this case, you can force the uninstallation by using the `--nodeps` flag. However, I would recommend proceeding with caution as this can potentially cause issues with your system.

Here's how you can force uninstall Zsh with its dependencies:

1. Open a terminal and run the following command to force uninstall Zsh:
```
sudo pacman -Rns --nodeps zsh
```
Please make sure to carefully review the list of packages that will be removed before proceeding. 

2. Delete Zsh configuration files: Run the following command to delete any remaining Zsh configuration files that might be present:
```
rm -rf ~/.z*
```

3. Reinstall Zsh: Now, you can reinstall Zsh by running the following command in the terminal:
```
sudo pacman -S zsh
```

4. Set Zsh as the default shell: To set Zsh as your default shell, run the following command:
```
chsh -s /bin/zsh
```
You will need to enter your password for authentication. After successful authentication, your default shell will be set to Zsh.

5. Create a new default Zsh configuration: Zsh provides a convenient way to generate a default configuration file. Run the following command in the terminal:
```
zsh -f
```
This will launch Zsh with a minimal configuration, and it will output the default configuration file.

6. Create a new Zsh configuration file: Run the following command to create a new Zsh configuration file:
```
echo "source /etc/zsh/zshrc" > ~/.zshrc
```

7. Restart your terminal or log out and log back in for changes to take effect.

Make sure to carefully review the output and perform backups before executing any uninstallation or removal commands to avoid any potential data loss or system instability.

**Response:**
I apologize for the confusion. The previous commands for uninstalling zsh could break your system because "zsh" is a dependency for manjaro-zsh-config and other zsh-plugins. Instead of uninstalling, here is a safer way to reset zsh to its default configuration:

1. Backup your existing `~/.zshrc` configuration:

   ```bash
   mv ~/.zshrc ~/.zshrc.backup
   ```

2. Generate a new default `.zshrc`:

   ```bash
   cp /etc/skel/.zshrc ~/
   ```

3. Apply the new defaults:

   ```bash
   source ~/.zshrc
   ```

This will effectively reset zsh to its default installation settings.

If you want to reinstall zsh without breaking dependencies, you can reinstall it directly:

```bash
sudo pacman -S zsh --overwrite '*'
```

This command re-installs Zsh and overwrites any existing files, which effectively serves as a "reset" of the software. Make sure to backup any important configuration before you run this command.

Remember to restart your terminal after finishing these steps to ensure the changes take effect.

**Prompt:**
and reinstall the dependencies too?

**Response:**
If you want to reinstall the dependencies along with Zsh, you can use the `--needed` flag with the `--asdeps` flag when installing Zsh. Here's how you can do that:

1. Reinstall Zsh along with dependencies:
```bash
sudo pacman -S zsh --asdeps --needed
```
This command will reinstall Zsh and its dependencies, ensuring that any missing dependencies are also installed.

2. Create a new default Zsh configuration:
```bash
cp /etc/skel/.zshrc ~/
```
This will generate a new default `.zshrc` configuration file based on the system defaults.

3. Apply the new defaults:
```bash
source ~/.zshrc
```

Remember to restart your terminal after completing these steps for the changes to take effect. Keep in mind that reinstalling dependencies might not be necessary in most cases, as they should already be installed on your system.
