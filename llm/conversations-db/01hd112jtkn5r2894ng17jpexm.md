**Prompt:**
Write a bash terminal command to error: bad substitution. code: prompt_picked="${!choice}"
Be concise, but include as much code as needed. Do not write anything else. Ever.


**Response:**
The error "bad substitution" occurs when using an invalid substitution syntax in bash. In this case, the error is caused by using the `${!choice}` syntax, which is not valid.

To fix this error, you need to use a valid substitution syntax. Here's an example of a correct substitution syntax:

```bash
prompt_picked="${choice}"
```

This will assign the value of the `choice` variable to the `prompt_picked` variable.
