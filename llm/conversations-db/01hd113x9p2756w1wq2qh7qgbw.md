**Prompt:**
error: bad substitution. code: choice="prompt$(echo -n 'A B C' | tr ' ' '
' | shuf -n 1)"
  prompt_picked="${!choice}"

**Response:**
The error "bad substitution" indicates that the variable you are trying to reference does not exist. In this case, it seems that you are trying to reference the variable with the name stored in the `$choice` variable using `${!choice}`.

However, the variable `choice` does not contain a valid variable name. It seems like you are trying to get a random choice from the options 'A', 'B', and 'C' and store it in `choice`. You can achieve that using the following code:

```bash
options=("A" "B" "C")
random_index=$(( RANDOM % ${#options[@]} ))
choice=${options[random_index]}
```

This code creates an array named `options` containing the options 'A', 'B', and 'C'. It then generates a random index within the range of the array's length and uses that index to select a random choice from the array and store it in the `choice` variable.
