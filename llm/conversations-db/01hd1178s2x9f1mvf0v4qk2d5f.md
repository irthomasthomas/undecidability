  prompt_picked="${!choice}"
  echo "$prompt_picked"

**Response:**
error: bad substitution. 

The error is occurring in the line `query="${1:-$(paster)}"`. The notation `${1:-$(paster)}` is used to assign the value of the first command-line argument (`$1`) to the variable `query`, but if no argument is provided, it uses the output of the `paster` command. 

However, the error suggests that there is a problem with substitution. It could be due to the `paster` command not being defined or there may be an issue with the syntax.

To fix this error, you can check for the existence of the `paster` command before using it and make sure the syntax is correct.
