**Response:**
The code snippet you provided is in bash and it seems like it's incomplete or syntax is not correct. Let's break down the script part which we can interpret:

1. The `explain()` function seems to take an input which is either provided as an argument or pasted (through a command `paster` which is not defined in your snippet). This input is stored into the variable `query`. If no argument is provided, it attempts to run the `paster` command to get the `query`.

2. The `promptA`, `promptB` and `promptC` are string variables that contain explanatory text templates with `$query` embedded.

3. `choice` variable is created to randomly select a string 'A' , 'B' or 'C'.

4. `prompt_picked` should contain the value of the randomly chosen prompt, but the syntax `"{!choice}"` is incorrect resulting in `bad substitution` error. 

What appears to be the intent of the script is to randomly select a prompt and to fill in the `$query` within that prompt.

The bad substitution error can be fixed by using `eval` to indirectly reference a variable's value:

```bash
prompt_picked=$(eval echo \$$choice)
```

However, please note that using `eval` can be dangerous if not used carefully as it allows arbitrary command execution. Always ensure that the variable used with `eval` is sanitized and safe for use.
