**Prompt:**
**System: Arch - Linux Kernel 6.0.**
          Explain this:
          lsof $file_name

**Response:**
The command "lsof $file_name" is used to list open files in a Linux system. 

Here's a breakdown of the command:

- "lsof" stands for "list open files". It is a command-line utility that displays information about files opened by processes on a Linux system.
- "$file_name" is a placeholder for the name of the file you want to check. You need to replace it with the actual file name or path.

When you run this command, it will display information about any processes that have the specified file open, including the process ID (PID), user, file descriptor, and other details. This can be useful for troubleshooting purposes, identifying which processes are using a particular file, or checking for any file locks.
