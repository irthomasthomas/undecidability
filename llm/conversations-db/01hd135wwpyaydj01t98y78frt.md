**Prompt:**
**System: Arch - Linux Kernel 6.0.**
          Explain this:
          sudo echo "alias 'pamac install'='yay -S'" | sudo tee -a /etc/profile.d/custom-aliases.sh 

**Response:**
In this command, we are using the `sudo` command to run two separate commands with elevated privileges.

The first command is `echo "alias 'pamac install'='yay -S'"`. This command is used to create an alias in the form of `pamac install` that will be replaced with `yay -S` whenever it is used in the terminal. The `echo` command is used to print the specified text, and in this case, we are printing the alias command.

The second command is `sudo tee -a /etc/profile.d/custom-aliases.sh`. The `tee` command is used to read from standard input and write to standard output and files simultaneously. The `-a` option is used to append the output to the specified file instead of overwriting it. In this case, we are appending the output of the previous `echo` command to the file `/etc/profile.d/custom-aliases.sh`.

Overall, this command is creating a custom alias for the `pamac install` command and adding it to the `/etc/profile.d/custom-aliases.sh` file. This allows the alias to be available system-wide for all users.
