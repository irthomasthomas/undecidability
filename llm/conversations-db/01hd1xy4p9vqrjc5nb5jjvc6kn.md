**Prompt:**
did not help

**Response:**
I'm sorry to hear that the previous command did not help. In that case, you can try to reinstall the GTK-related packages to see if it resolves the issue. Here's a command you can use to reinstall the GTK packages:

```
sudo pacman -S --overwrite='*' gtk3
```

This command will reinstall the "gtk3" package and overwrite any existing files. After running this command, you may need to reboot your system for the changes to take effect. If the issue persists, you can try reinstalling other related packages such as "gtk2", "gnome-themes-extra", or "adwaita-icon-theme".

Please note that reinstalling packages may result in some configuration changes, so make sure to review any prompts or warnings during the installation process.
