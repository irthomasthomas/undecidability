**Prompt:**
libEGL warning: DRI3: Screen seems not DRI3 capable
libEGL warning: DRI2: failed to authenticate
libEGL warning: egl: failed to create dri2 screen

**Response:**
These are warning messages typically related to rendering graphics on Linux-based systems, often due to some issues or incompatibilities with the graphics drivers.

"DRI" stands for Direct Rendering Infrastructure, a component of the X Window System that allows applications to access graphics hardware directly. DRI3 is the latest version of DRI. The warnings are indicating issues where:

- Your screen doesn't seem to be DRI3 capable indicating potential issues with your graphics driver or hardware.
- There has been a failure to authenticate with DRI2.
- There has been a failure to create a DRI2 screen.

If everything is still working fine despite these warning messages, you might just ignore them as they won't affect your system's functionality in most cases. However, if you are facing issues (like a program failing to run or graphical glitches), you might need to troubleshoot your graphics drivers or update them.

Additionally, these messages can often appear when running applications that use GPU-acceleration inside Docker containers, because the container may not have access to the GPU in the same way as host system. In such cases, additional configurations may be necessary to ensure that applications within the container can access and use the GPU correctly.

**Prompt:**
HELP ME RESOLVE THE WARNING

**Response:**
To resolve the warning, you would need to take the following steps:

1. **Check Your Graphics Driver:** The first step is to check whether the correct graphics driver is installed on your system. Use the `lshw -C video` command in the terminal to check your graphics driver's details. If your driver is out of date, you need to update it to the newest version.

2. **Update Your System:** In your terminal, run the following commands:
```bash
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get upgrade
```
These commands will update the system to the latest package.

3. **Update Mesa Drivers:** Mesa Drivers are also associated with libEGL. Update them using the following command:
```bash
sudo apt-get install mesa-utils
```
4. **Disable DRI 3:** If above does not solve the problem, you might need to disable DRI 3 and fall back to DRI 2. To do this, you need to create a new configuration file in the directory /usr/share/X11/xorg.conf.d/ (The filename doesn't matter, but it must end in .conf. For example, 20-intel.conf)

Then add the following lines to the file:
```bash
Section "Device"
   Identifier  "Intel Graphics"
   Driver      "intel"
   Option      "DRI"    "2" 
EndSection
```
Then reboot your computer for the changes to take effect.

Please note that in some cases it might not be possible to fully eliminate the warnings, especially if they are caused by underlying limitations in your graphics hardware or graphics driver. As such, there may be cases where the best course of action would be to configure your system or software to ignore these warnings.
