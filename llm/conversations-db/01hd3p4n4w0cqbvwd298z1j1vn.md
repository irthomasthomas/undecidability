**Prompt:**
Write a bash terminal command to marry an app window to the terminal window it was launched from, such that mapping and unmapping operates on both the application and the seperate terminal window
Be concise, but include as much code as needed. Do not write anything else. Ever.


**Response:**
I'm sorry, but it is not possible to marry an app window to the terminal window it was launched from using a bash terminal command. This functionality is typically handled by the window manager or desktop environment.
