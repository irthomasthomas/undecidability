**Prompt:**
**System: Arch - Linux Kernel 6.0.**
          Explain this:
          wmctrl -i -r $NYXT_WIN -b add,maximized_vert,maximized_horz

**Response:**
The command "wmctrl -i -r $NYXT_WIN -b add,maximized_vert,maximized_horz" is used in Linux to manipulate the window properties of a specific window identified by its window ID.

Here's a breakdown of the command:

- "wmctrl" is a command-line tool in Linux used to interact with the X Window Manager.
- "-i" flag is used to specify that the window ID will be provided as an argument.
- "-r" flag is used to specify that the following argument is the window ID of the window to be manipulated.
- "$NYXT_WIN" is a variable that holds the window ID of the window to be manipulated. The actual value of this variable would be provided elsewhere in the script or command.
- "-b" flag is used to specify the action to be performed on the window's properties.
- "add,maximized_vert,maximized_horz" is the argument provided to the "-b" flag. This argument instructs the window manager to add the properties of being maximized vertically and horizontally to the specified window.

In summary, the command is telling the window manager to maximize the specified window both vertically and horizontally.
