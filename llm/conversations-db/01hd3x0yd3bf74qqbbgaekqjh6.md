**Prompt:**
Is there a schema of sorts for openai EVALS, or where they after your knowledge cut off?

**Response:**
OpenAI EVALS may refer to an evaluation process or a set of benchmarks used to assess the performance of artificial intelligence systems, like GPT-3. However, regarding any specific 'schema', there may have been changes or developments after my knowledge cutoff in September 2021. You can typically find the most up-to-date and accurate information from OpenAI's own documentation, resources, or public communications.
