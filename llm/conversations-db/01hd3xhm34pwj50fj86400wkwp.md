ORIGINAL_REQUEST: Here is a sqlite db schema for the llm-cli tool database. When a request is made from llm-cli to openai gpt3 completions api, the result is stored in this database. I wish to update the schema to support a new feature: Human grading of the output. We will start with a basic feature set to support HUMAN EVALS. Propose a schema change.  

RESPONSE: Based on the requirement to support human grading of responses, you can add a new table named "evaluations". Here is how the schema change might look:

CREATE TABLE [evaluations] (
   [id] INTEGER PRIMARY KEY,
   [response_id] TEXT REFERENCES [responses]([id]),
   [evaluator_id] TEXT,
   [evaluation_grade] INTEGER,
   [evaluation_comment] TEXT,
   [evaluation_date] TEXT
);
Explanation:
1. `id`: The primary identifier for each evaluation.
2. `response_id`: This is a foreign key referencing the responses on which the evaluation was done.
3. `evaluator_id`: This field can hold the identifier of the user who did the evaluation.
4. `evaluation_grade`: This field will store the grade given by the evaluator. For simplicity, it can be an integer (e.g., 1-5 for a five-point scale evaluation).
5. `evaluation_comment`: This is a text field where evaluators can optionally leave a comment about their evaluation.
6. `evaluation_date`: The date when the evaluation was made.

This schema allows for each response to be graded by multiple evaluators, and it records who made the evaluation and when. If necessary, it can be extended to include more information about the context or content of the evaluation.

**Response:**
The proposed solution seems to be a good solution to add human evaluation of the output functionality to your database. By creating a new table "evaluations", this allows an evaluation grade, commentary, and associated metadata to be stored for each response in your application. 

However, it's important to ensure that the `evaluator_id` is referencing a real entity in your system, maybe you already have a "users" or "evaluators" table in your database and if so `evaluator_id` should be a foreign key referencing that table. 

Also, let's ensure `evaluation_date` is handled in a correct and consistent format - consider storing as TIMESTAMP instead of TEXT for ease of datetime related operations.

Finally, regarding OpenAI evals, as long as the system you are building allows for the saving and referencing of OpenAI model responses and their subsequent evaluations, there shouldn't be a problem. 

Overall, given these considerations and modifications, this proposed schema change should work well.
