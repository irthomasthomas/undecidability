**Prompt:**
Here is some json showing a summary of my bank spending. Write a bash script to parse the output and pretty print the response 
{"May 2023": 80.08, "June 2023": 52.89, "July 2023": 69.11, "natural_laguage_response": "In May 2023, you spent £80.08 on groceries. In June 2023, you spent £52.89 on groceries. In July 2023, you spent £69.11 on groceries."}

**Response:**
To parse and pretty print JSON in bash you can use the 'jq' command. This command line tool is great for parsing JSON. 

Let's assume the JSON is coming as output from some other command then the bash script would look like this: 

```bash
#!/bin/bash

your_other_command | jq .

```

If the JSON is saved to a file you can pretty print it like this:

```bash
#!/bin/bash

cat your_json_file.json | jq .

```

In your example JSON you would replace "your_json_file.json" or "your_other_command" with the actual file name or command that gives the JSON. This will output:

```bash
{
  "May 2023": 80.08,
  "June 2023": 52.89,
  "July 2023": 69.11,
  "natural_laguage_response": "In May 2023, you spent £80.08 on groceries. In June 2023, you spent £52.89 on groceries. In July 2023, you spent £69.11 on groceries."
}
```

This is a much more readable format where you can see the keys and values clearly.
