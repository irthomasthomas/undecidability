**Prompt:**
Here is some json showing a summary of my bank spending. Write a bash script to parse the output and pretty print the response in the form of a conversation. The data should be printed
{"May 2023": 80.08, "June 2023": 52.89, "July 2023": 69.11, "natural_laguage_response": "In May 2023, you spent £80.08 on groceries. In June 2023, you spent £52.89 on groceries. In July 2023, you spent £69.11 on groceries."}

**Response:**
Here's a simple bash script using `jq` to parse the JSON:

```bash
#!/bin/bash

JSON_DATA='{"May 2023": 80.08, "June 2023": 52.89, "July 2023": 69.11, "natural_laguage_response": "In May 2023, you spent £80.08 on groceries. In June 2023, you spent £52.89 on groceries. In July 2023, you spent £69.11 on groceries."}'

echo "Your spending summary is as follows:"
echo 

CONVERSATION=$(echo $JSON_DATA | jq -r '.natural_laguage_response')
echo $CONVERSATION
```

In this script, the variable JSON_DATA stores the JSON string. I use `jq` (a command-line JSON processor) with the `-r` flag to parse the 'natural_laguage_response' field, which contains the nicely formatted text.

Then, I simply print that message. This bash script assumes that `jq` is installed. If it's not, it can usually be installed with your package manager (apt, yum, brew, etc.).

The `-r` flag means that `jq` should output raw strings rather than JSON-encoded strings, handling the quote characters correctly.

Keep in mind that this script is quite simple and doesn’t handle any errors or unusual scenarios. For instance, it doesn't check if JSON_DATA actually contains the 'natural_laguage_response' field, or if `jq` is actually installed on the acting system.
