**Prompt:**
Here is some json showing a summary of my bank spending. Write a bash script to parse the output and pretty print the response in the form of a conversation. The data should be summarised below the natural language output
{"May 2023": 80.08, "June 2023": 52.89, "July 2023": 69.11, "natural_laguage_response": "In May 2023, you spent £80.08 on groceries. In June 2023, you spent £52.89 on groceries. In July 2023, you spent £69.11 on groceries."}

**Response:**
Your bash script may look something like this.

```bash
#!/bin/bash

# Load JSON file
json=$(cat spending.json)

# Parse and pretty print response
natural_response=$(echo "$json" | jq -r '.natural_laguage_response')
echo "Natural Language Response: $natural_response"
echo "-------------------------------"

# Parse and print spending summary
may_spending=$(echo "$json" | jq -r '."May 2023"')
june_spending=$(echo "$json" | jq -r '."June 2023"')
july_spending=$(echo "$json" | jq -r '."July 2023"')

echo "Summary"
echo "-------------------------------"
echo "May 2023 Spending: £$may_spending"
echo "June 2023 Spending: £$june_spending"
echo "July 2023 Spending: £$july_spending"
```

Before you run it, make sure to store the JSON data into the `spending.json` file.
And make sure you have `jq` installed on your machine, which is a command-line JSON processor. If you haven't, you can install it using `brew install jq` on macOS or `sudo apt-get install jq` on Ubuntu.

Remember to add execute permissions to your script after you save it, using the terminal command `chmod +x scriptname.sh`, then run with `./scriptname.sh`. 

Note: This code does not include validity checks and error handling you may wish to have in a production environment.
