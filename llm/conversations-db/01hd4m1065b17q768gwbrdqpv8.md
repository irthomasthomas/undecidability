**Prompt:**
Write a bash terminal command to configure jupyter for GPU accelleration
Be concise, but include as much code as needed. Do not write anything else. Ever.


**Response:**
sudo jupyter notebook --generate-config

**Prompt:**
Is that all?

**Response:**
No, that's just the first step to generate a Jupyter configuration file (if not already exists). Here are additional steps to use GPU acceleration:

1. You need to have CUDA installed for GPU acceleration:

   ```
   yay -S cuda
   ```

   Add CUDA to your PATH:
   ```
   echo 'export PATH=/opt/cuda/bin:${PATH}' >> ~/.bashrc
   ```

2. Install CUSOLVER, which is a library with GPU-accelerated mathematical functions:

   ```
   yay -S cusolver
   ```

3. Install required Python libraries 'ipython' and 'ipykernel':

   ```
   pip install ipython ipykernel
   ```

4. Install 'tensorflow-gpu', which is a Tensorflow version for using with GPU:

   ```
   pip install tensorflow-gpu
   ```

5. Test if Tensorflow can detect the GPU:

   ```
   python -c "import tensorflow as tf; print(tf.test.is_gpu_available())"
   ```

If the last command returns 'True', then your Jupyter notebook is now configured for GPU acceleration.

**Prompt:**
how to confirm cuda or cudnn are in path?

**Response:**
To confirm whether CUDA or cuDNN are in the PATH, you can use the following terminal commands:

To check if CUDA is in the PATH:
```
which nvcc
```

To check if cuDNN is in the PATH:
```
ls /usr/include/cudnn.h
```

If both commands return a valid path or location, it means that CUDA and cuDNN are in the PATH.
