**Response:**
The error message you're seeing typically indicates a problem with building the TensorFlow GPU package. This could be due to a number of reasons including incompatibility with your Python version or other system issues. 

Here are a few potential solutions:

1. **Check your Python Version:** TensorFlow 2.x requires Python 3.6-3.8 and TensorFlow 1.x requires Python 2.7-3.7. If your Python version is not compatible, you may need to upgrade or downgrade it.

2. **Check Your pip Version:** The pip version might also cause these types of issues. Try upgrading pip using the command `pip install --upgrade pip`.

3. **Install Visual C++ Tools for Visual Studio:** On Windows, TensorFlow requires Visual C++ 2015-2019. You can download it from the Microsoft website.

4. **Install Using Conda:** Another option is to install `tensorflow-gpu` using Conda. Install it using `conda install tensorflow-gpu`.

5. **By using Docker Images:** TensorFlow provides Docker images for using TensorFlow GPU. Use them in case other methods did not work.

Remember to activate the appropriate Python environment if you're using one, and ensure your CUDA and cuDNN versions are compatible with the TensorFlow version you're trying to install. 

Lastly, checking the full pip output in the provided log file `/home/thomas/.local/pipx/logs/cmd_2023-10-19_19.54.50_pip_errors.log` might provide more information on what specifically is causing the error.
