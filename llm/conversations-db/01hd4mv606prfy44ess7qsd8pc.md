pip seemed to fail to build package:
    tensorflow-gpu

Some possibly relevant errors from pip install:
    error: subprocess-exited-with-error
    setuptools.extern.packaging._tokenizer.ParserSyntaxError: Expected end or semicolon (after name and no valid version specifier)
    error: metadata-generation-failed
Be concise, but include as much code as needed. Do not write anything else. Ever.


**Response:**
The error you're experiencing seems to be related to package dependencies or an unexpected error during package building process. Sometimes a regular pip installation might resolve the issue. In this case, tensorflow-gpu requires a specific version of pip, python, and optionally, Nvidia CUDA Toolkit (required for GPU version).

For installing tensorflow-gpu, first ensure you have the correct Python version, Pip version and optionally Nvidia CUDA Toolkit:

1. Python 3.11: `python --version`
2. Pip version: `pip3 --version`. If an upgrade is required, use `pip install --upgrade pip` 
3. Nvidia CUDA Toolkit for GPU support: `nvidia-smi`

After checking and/or updating those, let's try to install the TensorFlow GPU version again in a virtual environment:

1. Create a new virtual environment: `python -m venv tf_env`
2. Activate the environment: `source tf_env/bin/activate`
3. Try installing TensorFlow GPU version: `pip install tensorflow-gpu`

Remember, you should replace `python` with `python3` and `pip` with `pip3` if you have both Python 2 and 3 installed on your system.

          python_version>"3.7"

**Response:**
Based on the error, it seems that the version of TensorFlow you're trying to install isn't compatible with Python 3.11 because it requires a Python version greater than 3.7 but less than 3.11.

Try installing a previous version of TensorFlow that is compatible with your Python version.

Here is how you can install TensorFlow version 2.7.0 which is the latest version as of October, 2022,

```bash
source tf_env/bin/activate
pip install tensorflow-gpu==2.7.0
```

Please replace `2.7.0` with the latest version compatible with your Python 3.11 if later versions are available.

**Prompt:**
how can I get a list of available versions?

**Response:**
You can get a list of all available versions of a specific Python package using the `yolk` package with the `-V` option. First, you need to install `yolk3k` using pip. Then, you can use it to list all versions of TensorFlow.

Here is how you do it:

1. Install yolk3k: `pip install yolk3k`
2. List all versions of TensorFlow: `yolk -V tensorflow-gpu`
