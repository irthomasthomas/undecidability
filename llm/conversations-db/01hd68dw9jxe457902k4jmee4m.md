==> ERROR: A failure occurred in build().
    Aborting...
 -> error making: python-onnx-exit status 4
 -> Failed to install the following packages. Manual intervention is required:
python-onnx - exit status 4

**Response:**
The error indicates that while trying to build the 'python-onnx' package, a command failed during the build process, causing it to abort. 

Possible Solutions:

1. Make sure you have the necessary dependencies installed before starting the build. You can find the list of necessary dependencies on the official Onnx documentation or the package documentation.

2. Verify that '/usr/include/python3.11' and '/home/thomas/.venv/bin/python' paths exist in your system.

3. Make sure you're using an appropriate version of Python. In this case, it mentions 'python3.11'. 

4. The error could be due to some issues with your environmental variables. You might want to consider resetting them back to their default: 
```bash
source /etc/environment
```
5. You could also have a look at the logs to see exactly why the command failed. It could give you idea about what went wrong.

6. If you are trying to install a library that depends on ONNX, it might be worth also attempting to install ONNX with pip:
```bash
pip install onnx
```
If none of these solutions work, consider posting these errors on forums or open a new issue on the GitHub repository of the module you're installing. They'll be able to provide next steps for resolving these issues.
