**Prompt:**
python -c "import tensorflow as tf; print(tf.config.list_physical_devices('GPU'))"                 ✔  2m 55s   thomas  
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "<string>", line 1, in <module>
ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'tensorflow'

**Response:**
This error message is indicating that the Python TensorFlow library is not installed in your current environment. 

To solve this issue, you need to install TensorFlow. Here's how:

1. Ensure you have Python installed on your machine. TensorFlow requires Python 3.5 or later.
2. Install the TensorFlow library by using pip, Python's package installer. Use this command to install:

    `pip install tensorflow`

   If Python 2 is your system's default version, you may need to use pip3 instead:

    `pip3 install tensorflow`

3. Verify the installation by running the command again:

    `python -c "import tensorflow as tf; print(tf.config.list_physical_devices('GPU'))"`

If you do not have the pip package installed, you will need to install that first by downloading get-pip.py (https://bootstrap.pypa.io/get-pip.py) and running it with Python:

    `python get-pip.py`

Please note, if you are on a system without a GPU, the "list_physical_devices('GPU')" function will return an empty list. TensorFlow will still work and will use the CPU instead.
