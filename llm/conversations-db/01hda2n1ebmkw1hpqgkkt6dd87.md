**Prompt:**
 fourcc = 'MP4V' 

cv2.error: OpenCV(4.8.1) :-1: error: (-5:Bad argument) in function 'VideoWriter'
> Overload resolution failed:
>  - Argument 'fourcc' is required to be an integer

**Response:**
The error is due to the fact that the `fourcc` argument in the `VideoWriter` function expects an integer, but you are providing a string. `fourcc` is a 4-byte code used to specify the video codec. The list of available codes can be found in fourcc.org.

To solve this, you need to use the `cv2.VideoWriter_fourcc` function to convert the four character code to an integer. Here is an example:

```python
fourcc = cv2.VideoWriter_fourcc(*'MP4V')
```

This function will convert the four character code into an integer which can be used as the `fourcc` argument in the `VideoWriter` function.

**Prompt:**
# Prepare video writer
        fourcc = 'MP4V'  # This could make the system request the specific codec
        params = [
            cv2.VIDEOWRITER_PROP_HW_ACCELERATION,
            cv2.VIDEOWRITER_PROP_HW_DEVICE,
            0,  # Change it according to your preferred device
        ]
        out = cv2.VideoWriter('lightning_output.avi', fourcc, frame_rate, (frame_width, frame_height))

**Response:**
The error is resulted from using `fourcc` as a string. It should be an integer. To convert the `fourcc` from a string to an integer, use the `cv2.VideoWriter_fourcc()` function.  the modified code should look something like this:

```python
# Prepare video writer
fourcc = cv2.VideoWriter_fourcc(*'MP4V')  # Convert fourcc from str to int with cv2.VideoWriter_fourcc()

params = [
    cv2.VIDEOWRITER_PROP_HW_ACCELERATION,
    cv2.VIDEOWRITER_PROP_HW_DEVICE,
    0,  # Change it according to your preferred device
]

out = cv2.VideoWriter(
    'lightning_output.avi',
    fourcc,
    frame_rate,
    (frame_width, frame_height)
)
```

If you're still having problems, ensure that the 'MP4V' codec is installed on your machine. If it's not, you might use different codecs like 'MJPG'. Also, the output file extension should match with fourcc codec i.e `.mp4` for 'MP4V'. Change output file name to `'lightning_output.mp4'`.

**Prompt:**
How do I find the number for mp4?

**Response:**
You don't need to find a specific number for MP4. OpenCV provides a function `cv2.VideoWriter_fourcc()` for this purpose. 

To specify an MP4 codec, you should pass 'MP4V' (or 'mp4v') to `cv2.VideoWriter_fourcc()` function as I've shown in the previous example. 

Here's how it works in Python:

```python
# Prepare video writer
fourcc = cv2.VideoWriter_fourcc(*'MP4V')  # specify the codec 'MP4V' for mp4 format.
out = cv2.VideoWriter('output.mp4', fourcc, 20.0, (640,480))  # specify output file name as output.mp4
```

This automatically converts the four-character code for MP4 into the appropriate integer value that the `VideoWriter` constructor needs.
