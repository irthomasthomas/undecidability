**Prompt:**
Cannot find reference 'VideoWriter_fourcc' in '__init__.pyi' 

**Response:**
The error message indicates that the module `cv2` cannot find a function or method called `VideoWriter_fourcc`. This error might happen for a couple of reasons:

1. You might not have correctly installed the `opencv-python` package in your environment. You can install it via pip:
```bash
pip install opencv-python
```

2. You might be trying to call `VideoWriter_fourcc` method in a wrong way. The appropriate way to call `cv2` method is:
```python
fourcc = cv2.VideoWriter_fourcc(*'XVID')
```

3. Your installed version doesn't support the `VideoWriter_fourcc`. The method `VideoWriter_fourcc`was added in OpenCV 2.4. In this case, you need to upgrade your OpenCV version.
```bash
pip install --upgrade opencv-python
```

If these solutions doesn't solve your issue, please provide more information about your environment such as your Python version, OpenCV version, OS, and where/how you're trying to use `VideoWriter_fourcc`.
