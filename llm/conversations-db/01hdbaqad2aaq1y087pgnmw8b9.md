**Prompt:**
Get the resolution of a video frame in python cv2

**Response:**
You can use the `shape` attribute of the image array to get the resolution (width and height) of a video frame using OpenCV in Python. Here is an example:

```python
import cv2

# Load video file
cap = cv2.VideoCapture('path/to/video.mp4')

# Read the first frame
ret, frame = cap.read()

# Get the resolution of the frame
height, width, channels = frame.shape

# Print the resolution
print(f'Resolution: {width}x{height}')

# Release video capture object
cap.release()
```

In this example, we first load the video file using `cv2.VideoCapture()` and then read the first frame using `cap.read()`. The `frame.shape` attribute gives us a tuple containing the height, width, and number of channels in the frame. We then extract the height and width from this tuple and print it. Finally, we release the video capture object to free up system resources.
