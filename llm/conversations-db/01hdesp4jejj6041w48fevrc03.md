**Prompt:**
Here is a rough idea. Can you suggest improvements to make it more robust or performant or more readable? Think carefully. 

```bash
send_note() {
    target_project="undecidability"
    cd $HOME/"$target_project"
    TITLE="$(cat /tmp/nyxt_title)"
    BODY="$(cat /tmp/nyxt_url)\n$(cat /tmp/nyxt_Selection)"
    LABEL="unclassified"
    gh issue create --title "$TITLE" --body "$BODY" --label "$LABEL"
}
```



```lisp
(define-command-global pipe-selection ()
    "Send selection to named pipe"
    (let ((selection (ps-eval (ps:chain window (get-selection) (to-string)))))
        (uiop:launch-program (list "sh" "-c" (format nil "echo %s >> /tmp/nyxt_Selection" selection)))))

(define-command-global pipe-selection-title-url ()
    (let* ((title (title (current-buffer)))
           (url (url (current-buffer)))
           (selection (ps-eval (ps:chain window (get-selection) (to-string)))))
        (uiop:launch-program
            (list "sh" "-c"
                  (concatenate 'string
                               "echo " "'" title "' > /tmp/nyxt_title" "
echo " "'" url "' > /tmp/nyxt_url" "
echo " "'" selection "' > /tmp/nyxt_selection")))))
```


**Response:**
Here're some improvements to make the code more robust, performant and readable:

1. Add input validation and error handling: your script is currently not validating the inputs to send_note function. It also doesn't handle errors such as situations when the directory doesn't exist, or when the 'gh' tool or temporary files are not available.

2. Use mktemp: In bash code, temporary filenames are hardcoded. It's better to use mktemp for generating temporary filenames, to avoid any potential race conditions or overwrites.

3. Use UUID for temporary filenames: As an alternative to mktemp, to avoid filename collisions use UUID or random strings for temporary file's name.

4. Code readability and proper newline: For bash script, use echo -e to enable interpretation of backslash escapes which allows proper newline. 

Given these points, here's your improved code:

Improvement 1 - Input validation & Error handling

```bash
send_note() {
    target_project="undecidability"
    target_directory=$HOME/"$target_project"
    if [ ! -d "${target_directory}" ]; then
        echo "Cannot find directory ${target_directory}"
        return 1
    fi

    cd "${target_directory}" || return 2

    if [ ! -f "/tmp/nyxt_title" ] || [ ! -f "/tmp/nyxt_url" ] || [ ! -f "/tmp/nyxt_Selection" ]; then
        echo "Cannot find required files"
        return 3
    fi

    TITLE="$(cat /tmp/nyxt_title)"
    BODY="$(cat /tmp/nyxt_url)\n$(cat /tmp/nyxt_Selection)"
    LABEL="unclassified"

    if ! command -v gh &>/dev/null; then
        echo "gh could not be found"
        return 4
    fi

    gh issue create --title "$TITLE" --body "$BODY" --label "$LABEL"
    return 0
}
```

Improvement 2 - Use mktemp for generating temporary files
```lisp
(define-command-global pipe-selection ()
    "Send selection to named pipe"
    (let ((selection (ps-eval (ps:chain window (get-selection) (to-string))))
          (temp-file (uiop:run-program '("mktemp") :output '(:string :stripped))))
      (uiop:launch-program (list "sh" "-c" (format nil "echo %s >> %s" selection temp-file)))))

(define-command-global pipe-selection-title-url ()
    (let* ((title (title (current-buffer)))
           (url (url (current-buffer)))
           (selection (ps-eval (ps:chain window (get-selection) (to-string))))
           (temp-title (uiop:run-program '("mktemp") :output '(:string :stripped)))
           (temp-url (uiop:run-program '("mktemp") :output '(:string :stripped)))
           (temp-selection (uiop:run-program '("mktemp") :output '(:string :stripped))))
        (uiop:launch-program
            (list "sh" "-c"
                  (concatenate 'string
                               "echo " "'" title "' > " temp-title "
echo " "'" url "' > " temp-url "
echo " "'" selection "' > " temp-selection)))))
```
All these changes help make your code more robust, faster, and easier to read. Keep coding!
