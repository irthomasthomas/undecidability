**Prompt:**
For finding the terminal, first search for WM_CLASS(STRING) = "konsole", "konsole", then search within those for WM_NAME(STRING) = "~ : nyxt". 

#!/bin/bash
nyxt_wm_class_string=("nyxt")

window_id=`xdotool search --class ${nyxt_wm_class_string} | head -1`

if [ "$window_id" != "" ]; then
  echo "The window with class ${nyxt_wm_class_string} exists."
  if xwininfo -id $window_id | grep "Map State: IsViewable"; then
    echo "The window is mapped (visible)"
    xdotool windowminimize $window_id
  else
    echo "The window is unmapped (hidden)"
    xdotool windowmap $window_id
    xdotool windowactivate $window_id
  fi
else
  echo "The window with class ${nyxt_wm_class_string} does not exist."
  nyxt
fi

**Response:**
This script is used to find and manipulate a terminal window with the WM_CLASS "nyxt". 

Here's how it works:

1. The script defines the nyxt_wm_class_string variable with the value "nyxt".
2. It uses the xdotool command to search for windows with the WM_CLASS "nyxt" and stores the first window ID in the window_id variable.
3. If a window with the specified WM_CLASS exists, it checks if the window is mapped (visible) using the xwininfo command and the window ID.
4. If the window is mapped, it minimizes the window using the xdotool windowminimize command.
5. If the window is not mapped (hidden), it maps the window using the xdotool windowmap command, activates the window using the xdotool windowactivate command, and brings it to the front.
6. If no window with the specified WM_CLASS exists, it prints a message and starts a new instance of the nyxt terminal using the nyxt command.

This script can be used to find and manipulate the terminal window with the specified WM_CLASS "nyxt".
