**Prompt:**
Also tell me the number of records that will be deleted (if any) from each table.


```bash
#!/bin/bash

# Step 1: Read the log entry id from user input
read -p "Enter the log entry id to delete: " log_id

# Step 2: Check if the log entry exists in the "logs" table
log_exists=$(sqlite3 database.db "SELECT COUNT(*) FROM logs WHERE id = $log_id")

if [ $log_exists -eq 0 ]; then
  echo "Log entry with id $log_id does not exist."
  exit 1
fi

# Step 3: Get the conversation id associated with the log entry from the "responses" table
conversation_id=$(sqlite3 database.db "SELECT conversation_id FROM responses WHERE id = (SELECT response_id FROM evaluations WHERE response_id = $log_id)")

if [ -z $conversation_id ]; then
  echo "Conversation id not found for log entry with id $log_id."
  exit 1
fi

# Step 4: Confirm the changes with the user
echo "The following changes will be made:"
echo "- Log entry with id $log_id will be deleted."
echo "- All evaluations associated with log entry id $log_id will have their response_id set to NULL."
echo "- All log entries and responses associated with conversation id $conversation_id will be deleted."
read -p "Confirm the changes (Y/N): " confirm

if [ "$confirm" != "Y" ] && [ "$confirm" != "y" ]; then
  echo "Changes canceled."
  exit 1
fi

# Step 5: Delete the log entry from the "logs" table
sqlite3 database.db "DELETE FROM logs WHERE id = $log_id"

# Step 6: Update or delete references in other tables
sqlite3 database.db "UPDATE evaluations SET response_id = NULL WHERE response_id = $log_id"

# Step 7: Delete all log entries and responses associated with the conversation id
sqlite3 database.db "DELETE FROM logs WHERE id IN (SELECT id FROM logs WHERE chat_id = $conversation_id OR reply_to_id = $conversation_id)"
sqlite3 database.db "DELETE FROM responses WHERE conversation_id = $conversation_id"

echo "Log entry with id $log_id and all associated entries have been deleted successfully."
```

**Response:**
The number of records that will be deleted from each table is as follows:

- "logs" table: 1 record (the log entry with the specified log_id)
- "evaluations" table: 1 record (the evaluation with the specified response_id)
- "logs" table (associated with conversation_id): All log entries with chat_id or reply_to_id equal to the specified conversation_id will be deleted.
- "responses" table: All responses with the specified conversation_id will be deleted.
