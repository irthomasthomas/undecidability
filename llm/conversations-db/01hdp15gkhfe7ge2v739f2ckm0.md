**Response:**
It seems that there are errors in the log entry deletion process. The unrecognized token error suggests that the log entry ID provided is not recognized or formatted correctly. Additionally, there is an error with the unary operator expected in line 6 of the delete_llm_entry.sh script.

To resolve these issues, you can try the following steps:

1. Double-check the log entry ID you are entering to ensure it is correct and properly formatted.
2. Review the delete_llm_entry.sh script and check for any syntax errors or missing variables.
3. Make sure that the necessary database tables and columns exist and are correctly referenced in the script.
4. If the issues persist, consider seeking assistance from a developer or technical support to debug the script and identify the root cause of the errors.
