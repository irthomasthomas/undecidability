**Response:**
The log entry with id "01hdgnhcdazdzpqq5wkdggeap4" will be deleted. The script checks if the log entry exists in the "responses" table and the "conversations" table. If it exists, it prompts the user to confirm the deletion. If confirmed, it deletes the log entry and all associated entries from both tables. Finally, it displays a success message.
