**Response:**
The error message "mkfifo: cannot create fifo '/tmp/nyxt_title': File exists" indicates that the named pipe `/tmp/nyxt_title` already exists. 

To solve this issue, you can modify the script to check if the named pipe exists before attempting to create it. Here's an updated version of the script:

```bash
#!/bin/bash

send_note_to_github() {
    echo "Send Note To Github"
    target_project="undecidability"
    target_directory="$HOME/$target_project"

    pipe_title="/tmp/nyxt_title"
    pipe_url="/tmp/nyxt_url"
    pipe_selection="/tmp/nyxt_selection"

    # Delete named pipes if they exist
    if [ -p "${pipe_title}" ]; then
        rm "${pipe_title}" && echo "Deleted named pipe: $pipe_title"
    fi

    if [ -p "${pipe_url}" ]; then
        rm "${pipe_url}" && echo "Deleted named pipe: $pipe_url"
    fi

    if [ -p "${pipe_selection}" ]; then
        rm "${pipe_selection}" && echo "Deleted named pipe: $pipe_selection"
    fi

    # Create named pipes if they don't exist
    if [ ! -p "${pipe_title}" ]; then
        mkfifo "${pipe_title}" && echo "Created named pipe: $pipe_title"
    fi

    if [ ! -p "${pipe_url}" ]; then
        mkfifo "${pipe_url}" && echo "Created named pipe: $pipe_url"
    fi

    if [ ! -p "${pipe_selection}" ]; then
        mkfifo "${pipe_selection}" && echo "Created named pipe: $pipe_selection"
    fi

    if [ ! -d "${target_directory}" ]; then
        echo "Cannot find directory ${target_directory}"
        return 1
    fi

    cd "${target_directory}" || return 2
    echo "$PWD"

    if [ ! -p "${pipe_title}" ] || [ ! -p "${pipe_url}" ] || [ ! -p "${pipe_selection}" ]; then
        echo "Cannot find required pipes"
        return 3
    fi
    echo "Found pipes"

    TITLE="$(cat ${pipe_title})"

    BODY="$(cat ${pipe_url})
$(cat ${pipe_selection})"

    LABEL="unclassified"
    echo "TITLE: $TITLE"
    echo "BODY: $BODY"
    echo "LABEL: $LABEL"
    if ! command -v gh &>/dev/null; then
        echo "gh could not be found"
        return 4
    fi

    echo "Creating gh issue"
    gh issue create --title "$TITLE" --body "$BODY" --label "$LABEL"
    return 0
}

while true
do
    send_note_to_github
done
```

In this updated version, the script checks if the named pipes exist before attempting to delete them. Then, it checks if the named pipes exist before attempting to create them. This ensures that the named pipes are properly created and avoids the "File exists" error.
