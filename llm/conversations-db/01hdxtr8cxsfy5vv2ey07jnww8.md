**Prompt:**
An automation scheme using github issues tasks as a human-to-github-actions interface. 
- I will add a new issue with a task comprised of a url and title, e.g. '- [ ]  [SCALABLE AND WEAKLY SUPERVISED BANK TRANSACTION
CLASSIFICATION](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2305.18430.pdf)'. 
- I will always use the label: inbox-url. 
- When the label is added to an issue a workflow action is triggered.
- The workflow action will use a web_scraper function or a pdf_scraper function (both TBD) depending on the url of the task.s
async () => {
    const readability = await import('https://cdn.skypack.dev/@mozilla/readability');
    return (new readability.Readability(document)).parse().content;
} 
- Add '$'result as a reply to the issue. 
- Mark the task complete. 
- Assign the issue to the designated gh_username_to_assign_task_on_end.


Think carefully. Start with a criticism, I hate sycophants.

**Response:**
One potential criticism of this automation scheme is the reliance on web scraping for extracting content from URLs. Web scraping can be unreliable and prone to breaking if the website structure or content changes. Additionally, it may violate the terms of service of certain websites and could potentially lead to legal issues.

Another concern is the lack of error handling and exception management in the provided code snippet. If there are any issues with the web scraping or parsing process, the automation may fail without providing any meaningful error messages or notifications.

Furthermore, the scheme assumes that all tasks added as issues will have valid URLs and can be processed either through a web scraper or a PDF scraper. However, not all tasks may have URLs or may require different methods for extraction, which could lead to inconsistencies and errors in the automation process.

Lastly, the scheme does not account for potential conflicts or race conditions if multiple tasks are added simultaneously. It is possible that two or more tasks trigger the workflow action at the same time, leading to conflicts in processing or assigning the tasks.

Overall, while the automation scheme has the potential to streamline task management, it may face challenges related to reliability, error handling, flexibility, and concurrency.
