**Prompt:**
An automation scheme using github issues tasks as a human-to-github-actions interface. 
- I will add a new issue with a task comprised of a url and title, e.g. '- [ ]  [SCALABLE AND WEAKLY SUPERVISED BANK TRANSACTION
CLASSIFICATION](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2305.18430.pdf)'. 
- I will always use the label: inbox-url. 
- When the label is added to an issue a workflow action is triggered. 
- If an issue labeled inbox-url does not contain an incomplete task and a valid url, that is an error. So generate an useful error message and add it as an issue reply.
- The workflow action will use a web_scraper procedure or a pdf_scraper procedure (both TBD) depending on the url of the task. An idea for part of the web_scraper could use readability, in addition to other methods. 
async () => {
    const readability = await import('https://cdn.skypack.dev/@mozilla/readability');
    return (new readability.Readability(document)).parse().content;
} 
- Add '$'result as a reply to the issue. 
- Mark the task complete. 
- Assign the issue to the designated gh_username_to_assign_task_on_end.

* There should be no dependencies or shared assets leading to race conditions. Only thing is to perhaps immediately remove the inbox-url label and replace it with an intermediary label until the job completes. Like a pipeline of different stages.

Think carefully. Start with a criticism, I hate sycophants.

**Response:**
One potential criticism of this automation scheme is that it heavily relies on the consistency and accuracy of the issue format and labeling. If the users do not follow the specified format or label the issues correctly, it could lead to errors or incomplete tasks. This could be mitigated by implementing stricter validation checks or providing clear instructions to the users.

Another concern is the reliance on external web scraping procedures, such as the web_scraper and pdf_scraper. These procedures may not always work reliably or may require constant updates to handle different website structures or PDF formats. It would be important to thoroughly test and maintain these procedures to ensure their effectiveness.

Additionally, the proposed workflow does not account for potential errors or issues that may occur during the web scraping process. If the web scraper encounters any problems, such as a website being down or a PDF being inaccessible, there is no mechanism in place to handle these situations. It would be beneficial to implement error handling and notifications to alert the users or administrators of any issues encountered during the automation process.

Lastly, the automation scheme assumes that the designated gh_username_to_assign_task_on_end is always available and capable of handling the assigned tasks. If this user is unavailable or overloaded with tasks, it could lead to delays or bottlenecks in the automation process. It might be worth considering a more flexible assignment mechanism or a way to distribute the tasks among multiple users if needed.
