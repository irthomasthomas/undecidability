**Prompt:**
An automation scheme using a private github repo issues tasks as a human-to-github-actions interface. 

- I shall be the sole user of this system. I am the human Overseer, orchestrating the Augmented Intelligence system.
- Overseer will interact with the github issues using a TUI built from rust or python scripts, including unit tests.

- I will add a new issue with a task comprised of a url and title, e.g. '- [ ]  [SCALABLE AND WEAKLY SUPERVISED BANK TRANSACTION
CLASSIFICATION](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2305.18430.pdf)'. 
- I will always use the label: inbox-url. 
- When the label is added to an issue a workflow action is triggered. 
- If an issue labeled inbox-url does not contain an incomplete task and a valid url, that is an error. So generate an useful error message and add it as an issue reply.
- The workflow action will use a web_scraper procedure or a pdf_scraper procedure (both TBD) depending on the url of the task. An idea for part of the web_scraper could use readability, in addition to other methods. 
async () => {
    const readability = await import('https://cdn.skypack.dev/@mozilla/readability');
    return (new readability.Readability(document)).parse().content;
} 
- Add '$'result as a reply to the issue. 
- Mark the task complete. 
- Assign the issue to the designated gh_username_to_assign_task_on_end.

* There should be no dependencies or shared assets leading to race conditions. Only thing is to perhaps immediately remove the inbox-url label and replace it with an intermediary label until the job completes. Like a pipeline of different stages.

Think carefully. Start with a criticism, I hate sycophants.

**Response:**
One potential criticism of this automation scheme is the lack of error handling and validation for the input tasks. While the system expects the tasks to be in a specific format, there is no mechanism in place to validate or handle incorrect or malformed tasks. This could lead to issues being created with invalid or incomplete information, causing confusion and potentially disrupting the workflow.

Additionally, relying on a web scraper or PDF scraper procedure without specifying the details or implementation can be problematic. These procedures can be complex and prone to errors, especially when dealing with different types of URLs or PDF formats. It would be important to thoroughly test and handle potential edge cases to ensure the reliability and accuracy of the scraped content.

Furthermore, the proposed automation scheme assumes that the web scraper or PDF scraper procedure will always be able to extract the desired content from the provided URLs. However, there may be cases where the procedure fails to extract the required information, resulting in incomplete or incorrect replies being added to the issues.

Lastly, the use of an intermediary label to track the progress of the tasks could lead to confusion or potential race conditions if multiple tasks are being processed simultaneously. It would be essential to carefully manage the labeling and assignment process to avoid conflicts or overlapping actions.

Overall, it is crucial to thoroughly consider and address potential issues and edge cases to ensure the reliability, accuracy, and usability of the automation scheme.

**Prompt:**
1: The input will be validated before being passed to this system.
2: The web scraping may be complex, but we are only concerned with building the interface to that scraping in this project. You may assume the scraping is handled.
3. See above.
4. How else could this automation scheme work?

**Response:**
1: If the input tasks are validated before being passed to the system, it addresses the concern of invalid or incomplete tasks being created. Validating the tasks can involve ensuring they adhere to a specific format, contain necessary information, and meet any other defined criteria. By implementing proper validation mechanisms, you can prevent errors and confusion in the workflow.

2: If the web scraping process is handled separately and the interface is already built, it mitigates the complexity and potential issues associated with scraping. Assuming the scraping process is reliable and accurate, the focus can shift to integrating the scraping results into the automation scheme effectively.

3: It appears that the previous point still stands. However, when relying on external services or procedures for web scraping, it's vital to consider error handling and contingency plans. If the scraping procedure fails to extract the desired information or encounters errors, having a mechanism to handle such situations gracefully would be advantageous.

4: There are alternative ways this automation scheme could work based on your requirements and constraints. Here are a few potential ideas:

a) Utilize a bot account: Instead of you manually adding issues, you can create a separate GitHub bot account dedicated to managing tasks. This bot account can have the necessary permissions to create, assign, and label issues. This way, you won't have to rely on a human interface and can directly send tasks to the bot account, triggering the workflow.

b) Email integration: Instead of using a TUI interface, you could set up an email-based interface. Tasks can be sent via email to a designated address, which the system automatically parses. The system can then process the tasks, perform necessary actions, and send replies back via email.

c) API-based integration: If you prefer a programmatic approach, you can build an API that accepts task submissions as JSON payloads. This would allow automated scripts or applications to send tasks directly to the API, triggering the workflow and providing a more streamlined integration for external systems.

These are just some alternative approaches to consider, depending on your specific requirements, workflow preferences, and technical capabilities.

**Prompt:**
The point of using GH issues is we have the option of automating the submission of issues via the gh cli or api, BUT we also have the option of inputing new tasks via the website on our phone, tablet or PC. 

**Response:**
Understood. The use of GitHub issues provides flexibility in terms of both automated and manual task submissions. The ability to automate issue submissions using the GitHub CLI or API allows for seamless integration with other systems or scripts. Simultaneously, the user-friendly interface available through the GitHub website enables manual task input from various devices.

By leveraging the GitHub issues system, you can take advantage of the convenience and accessibility it offers. Automated submissions via the CLI or API can streamline the process and ensure consistent formatting and validation. On the other hand, manual submissions via the website allow for ad-hoc task creation, allowing you to easily input new tasks on various devices as needed.

This combination of automation and manual input provides you with the flexibility to cater to your specific workflow preferences and context. Whether it's through programmatic interfaces or user-friendly web interfaces, the GitHub issues system can accommodate both automated and manual task submissions, enabling a seamless and efficient process.

**Prompt:**
Rewrite my original input addressing these issues so that they will be clear immediately to the next recipient.

**Response:**
An automation scheme utilizing a private GitHub repo for task management through issues, serving as a human-to-GitHub Actions interface.

- The primary user of this system is the human Overseer, who orchestrates the Augmented Intelligence system.
- The Overseer interacts with GitHub issues using a TUI built from Rust or Python scripts, including unit tests.
- Tasks are added as new issues and follow a specific format, such as '- [ ] [SCALABLE AND WEAKLY SUPERVISED BANK TRANSACTION
CLASSIFICATION](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2305.18430.pdf)', always labeled as "inbox-url."
- When an issue is labeled "inbox-url," a workflow action is triggered.
- An error occurs if an issue labeled "inbox-url" lacks an incomplete task or contains an invalid URL. In such cases, generate a helpful error message and add it as a reply to the issue.
- The workflow action employs a web scraper or PDF scraper (specific implementation to be determined) based on the task's URL. One possible web scraper approach could involve readability, among other methods.
- Add the result of the scraping procedure as a reply to the issue, denoted by '$result'.
- Mark the task as complete.
- Assign the issue to the designated GitHub username specified by 'gh_username_to_assign_task_on_end.'

Considerations:
- Validate and handle input tasks to avoid incorrect or incomplete information.
- Thoroughly test and handle potential errors and edge cases in the web scraping procedure.
- Ensure the reliability and accuracy of the scraped content.
- Manage labeling and assignment processes to prevent conflicts or overlapping actions.
- Allow both automated task submissions via GitHub CLI or API and manual task input through the GitHub website on various devices.
