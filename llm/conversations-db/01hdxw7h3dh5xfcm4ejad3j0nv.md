**Prompt:**
An automation scheme utilizing a private GitHub repo for task management through issues, serving as a human-to-GitHub Actions interface.

- The primary user of this system is the human Overseer, who orchestrates the Augmented Intelligence system.
- The Overseer interacts with GitHub issues using a TUI built from Rust or Python scripts, including unit tests.
- Tasks are added as new issues and follow a specific format, such as '- [ ] [SCALABLE AND WEAKLY SUPERVISED BANK TRANSACTION
CLASSIFICATION](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2305.18430.pdf)', always labeled as inbox-url.
- When an issue is labeled inbox-url, a workflow action is triggered.
- An error occurs if an issue labeled inbox-url lacks an incomplete task or contains an invalid URL. In such cases, generate a helpful error message and add it as a reply to the issue.
- The workflow action employs a web scraper or PDF scraper (specific implementation to be determined) based on the task's URL. One possible web scraper approach could involve readability, among other methods.
- Add the result of the scraping procedure as a reply to the issue, denoted by ''.
- Mark the task as complete.
- Assign the issue to the designated GitHub username specified by 'gh_username_to_assign_task_on_end.'

Considerations:
- Validate and handle input tasks to avoid incorrect or incomplete information.
- Thoroughly test and handle potential errors and edge cases in the web scraping procedure.
- Ensure the reliability and accuracy of the scraped content.
- Manage labeling and assignment processes to prevent conflicts or overlapping actions.
- Allow both automated task submissions via GitHub CLI or API and manual task input through the GitHub website on various devices.


What do you suggest as the next steps in planning this system?

**Response:**
1. Define System Requirements: Clearly outline the system's functional and non-functional requirements. This includes defining the system's behavior, performance requirements, security, and reliability.

2. Identify Key Components: Break down the system into key components such as the TUI, the web scraper, the task management system, and the GitHub Actions workflow.

3. Design the System Architecture: Sketch out a high-level architecture of the system, demonstrating how the key components interact with each other and with the end-user.

4. Plan Development Tasks: Break down the development process into manageable tasks. This may include tasks such as setting up the GitHub repository, developing the TUI, implementing the web scraper, setting up the GitHub Actions workflow, and writing the unit tests.

5. Prioritize Development Tasks: Determine the order in which the development tasks should be tackled. This could be based on the dependencies between tasks, the complexity of the tasks, or the risk associated with each task.

6. Plan Testing Strategy: Decide how you will test each component of the system and the system as a whole. This includes unit testing, integration testing, and system testing.

7. Plan for Error Handling: Plan how the system will handle errors at each stage of the process. This includes errors in the input tasks, errors during the web scraping process, and errors in the GitHub Actions workflow.

8. Plan for Deployment: Decide how and where the system will be deployed. This includes choosing a hosting platform and planning the deployment process.

9. Plan for Maintenance: Plan how the system will be maintained after it has been deployed. This includes monitoring the system, fixing bugs, and implementing new features. 

10. Documentation: Plan for comprehensive documentation for the system. This includes user manuals, system architecture diagrams, and code documentation.

**Prompt:**
Using all of the information I have given you above, and using the totality of your expertise in programming and systems automation, write the requiremenents as specified. 

First, ask me for any details that are missing, otherwise proceed as required.

**Response:**
Before proceeding with the detailed requirements, I'd need to clarify a few points:

- Please specify the language preference for the system (Python or Rust)? Both have their merits, but the decision can impact different areas, such as performance and ease of implementation.
- Could you provide more detail about the designated GitHub username specified by 'gh_username_to_assign_task_on_end'? How should it be determined for each task?
- Can you provide further details about the Text User Interface (TUI)? What specific functions should it provide to the user?
- For the web scraper, are there any specific websites or types of websites that it must be able to handle? 
- Can you provide more information about the error handling process you envision? What should happen when an error occurs (public notification, logging, silent fail etc.)?
- Your system will need storage to manage task progression status/data. What kind of storage do you envision (local, cloud, etc.), and have you considered any potential limitations (e.g. size limits, privacy/security needs)?

After these details are clarified, we'll be able to create a more accurate set of requirements.

**Prompt:**

- Python.
- username will be paramater
- TUI should allow the browsing of issues labeled 'overseer-inbox'. It should also have function stubs for add_new_task, reply_to_query.  
- Mostly articles.
- Errors should be logged as an issue reply.
- Everything will be stored as github issues or gh repo artifact.

**Response:**
Based on your specifications, here is the list of detailed requirements:

Functional Requirements:

1. The system should be coded in Python, making use of GitHub Action workflows.
2. The primary user will be a human overseer who interacts with the system through a Text User Interface (TUI).
3. The TUI should allow the browsing of issues labeled 'overseer-inbox'.
4. The TUI should provide functions for adding new tasks and replying to queries.
5. The new tasks should be submitted in the form of GitHub issues, following a set task format and labeled as inbox-url.
6. A workflow action should be triggered when an issue is labeled as an inbox-url.
7. If an inbox-url task is incomplete or contains an invalid URL, the system should flag an error and add a helpful error message to the task issue.
8. The system should be able to scrape textual content from web articles and PDF documents found through the task's URL.
9. The results of the web or PDF scraping should be added as a reply in the respective GitHub issue, marked by `''`.
10. Upon completion of content retrieval, the system should mark the task as complete.
11. After task completion, the issue is to be assigned to a provided GitHub username (`gh_username_to_assign_task_on_end`).

Non-Functional Requirements:

1. The system should efficiently and accurately scrape content from web articles and PDFs, primarily targeting articles.
2. The system should handle errors gracefully. Any error that occurs during the task execution should be logged as a reply to the task issue for review.
3. The system should be capable of handling multiple tasks simultaneously, managing task status and information through GitHub issues and GitHub Repo artifacts, ensuring no data loss.
4. The system should be secure, minimizing exposure to potential security risks during actions such as web scraping and issue management.
5. The system should provide clear and understandable notifications, especially during error conditions to facilitate troubleshooting and debugging.
6. The system should be maintainable and scalable, allowing for easy addition of new features and capabilities.

In the next step, these requirements would help in sketching an outline for the system design and defining the associated tasks for development.
