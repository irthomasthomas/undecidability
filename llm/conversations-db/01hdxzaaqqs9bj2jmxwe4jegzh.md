**Prompt:**
Dear Joseph,s
Please find below the instructions for tasks 2, 3, and 4 for our automation scheme project. 

**Task 2 - Implement Text User Interface (TUI):**

1. Design an interface using bash where users can browse through issues labeled as 'overseer-inbox'. This could be a simple list interface in the command line.
2. Within the TUI, also implement functions to add new issues/tasks and reply to queries. Input for the task could be a simple string, while the query replies could involve choosing options or entering detailed text.
3. Make sure the TUI is user-friendly with clear instructions and readable text.

**Task 3 - Implement GitHub Issue Creation From TUI:**

1. When a user adds a new task through the TUI, translate this into a new GitHub issue in our private repository.
2. Follow a set task format for issue creation. This could include details like date and time of creation, task description, creator, and other relevant details.
3. Label these issues as 'inbox-url'. 

**Task 4 - Implement GitHub Action Workflow:**

1. Design and implement a GitHub Actions workflow that is triggered when an issue labeled as 'inbox-url' is created.
2. The workflow should be configured to perform further tasks such as web scraping, replying to the issue with scraped information, marking the task as complete, etc. Currently, just the triggering of the workflow based on the condition of issue labelling is required.
   
Send me the completed code immediately.
Best, 
Edward
