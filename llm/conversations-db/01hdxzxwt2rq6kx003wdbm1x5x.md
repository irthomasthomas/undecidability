**Prompt:**
Write a script that reads from stdin and looks for markdown code blocks between backticks. When found, writes the content between the blocks as an appropriate file.

**Response:**
Here is a Python script that does exactly that:

```python
import sys
import re
import os

def extract_code_blocks(text):
    pattern = r'```(.*?)```'
    matches = re.findall(pattern, text, re.DOTALL)
    return matches

def write_to_file(code_blocks):
    for i, block in enumerate(code_blocks):
        with open(f'code_block_{i}.txt', 'w') as f:
            f.write(block)

def main():
    text = sys.stdin.read()
    code_blocks = extract_code_blocks(text)
    write_to_file(code_blocks)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

This script reads from stdin, extracts all markdown code blocks, and writes each block to a separate file. The files are named `code_block_0.txt`, `code_block_1.txt`, etc.

To use this script, you can pipe the input to it. For example:

```bash
cat your_file.md | python3 script.py
```

This will create one file for each code block in `your_file.md`.

Please note that this script does not handle the language specification in markdown code blocks (like ```python or ```javascript). If you need to handle this, you will need to modify the regular expression and the file writing part to take this into account.

**Prompt:**
Write it in bash. For filenames, call a function mkfilename code_content

**Response:**
If you prefer a pure Bash/Shell script solution, here is an example that can do the job:

```bash
#!/bin/bash

mkfilename() {
    echo "${1}" | tr -d '\n' | tr -c '[:alnum:]' '_'
}

text=''
while IFS= read -r line; do
    text="${text}\n${line}"
done

regex='\`\`\`(.+?)\`\`\`'
n=0
while [[ "${text}" =~ $regex ]]; do
    code_content="${BASH_REMATCH[1]}"
    text=${text/"```${code_content}```"/}
    
    filename=$(mkfilename "${code_content}")
    echo -e "${code_content}" > "${filename}_${n}"
    ((n++))
done
```

This bash script reads from stdin until EOF, then finds all markdown code blocks. It calls the provided `mkfilename` function to sanitize the code content to create a filename, before writing each code block to a file.

Please note that if there are multiple code blocks with the same content, the `_n` part in the filename will differentiate between these blocks.

You can use this script in the same way as the python script:

```bash
cat your_file.md | bash script.sh
```
