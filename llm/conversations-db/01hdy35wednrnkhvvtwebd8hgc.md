**Prompt:**
Write a bash script that reads from stdin and writes the content between the markdown code blocks as an appropriate file. For a filename, call mkfilename code_content.

**Response:**
Here is a simple bash script that reads from stdin and writes the content between markdown code blocks to a file. This script assumes that the code blocks are denoted by triple backticks (```). 

```bash
#!/bin/bash

# Initialize variables
in_code_block=false
filename=""

# Read from stdin
while IFS= read -r line
do
    # Check if the line starts a code block
    if [[ $line == \`\`\`* ]]; then
        if $in_code_block; then
            # If we're in a code block, this line ends it
            in_code_block=false
            # Close the file
            exec 3>&-
        else
            # If we're not in a code block, this line starts it
            in_code_block=true
            # Generate a filename
            filename="mkfilename_$(date +%s)"
            # Open the file for writing
            exec 3>"$filename"
        fi
    elif $in_code_block; then
        # If we're in a code block, write the line to the file
        echo "$line" >&3
    fi
done

# If we're still in a code block at the end, close the file
if $in_code_block; then
    exec 3>&-
fi
```

This script uses file descriptor 3 to write to the file. It generates a filename based on the current timestamp to ensure uniqueness. If you want to use a different naming scheme, you can modify the line that sets the `filename` variable.

To use this script, you can pipe the input to it. For example:

```bash
cat your_markdown_file.md | ./your_script.sh
```

This will create a file for each code block in the markdown file. The files will be named `mkfilename_<timestamp>`, where `<timestamp>` is the time at which the code block was processed.
