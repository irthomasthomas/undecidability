**Prompt:**
Fix this bash function. Think carefully. 

    text="${text}
${line}"

**Response:**
The function is not complete. It seems like it's trying to append a variable `$line` to another variable `$text` with a newline in between. However, it's not wrapped in a function. Here's a fixed version:

```bash
append_line_to_text() {
    local line=$1
    text="${text}
${line}"
}
```

This function `append_line_to_text` takes one argument, which is stored in the local variable `line`. It then appends this line to the global variable `text` with a newline in between.
