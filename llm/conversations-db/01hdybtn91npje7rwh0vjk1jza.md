**Prompt:**
Fix this bash function. Think carefully. 

save_codeblock_to_file() {
  # Initialize variables
  in_code_block=false
  filename=""
  n=1
  # Read from stdin
  while IFS= read -r line; do
    text="${text}
${line}"
  done
    
      # Check if the line starts a code block
      if [[ $line == \`\`\`* ]]; then
          if $in_code_block; then
              # If we're in a code block, this line ends it
              in_code_block=false
              # Close the file
              exec 3>&-
          else
              # If we're not in a code block, this line starts it
              in_code_block=true
              # Generate a filename
              filename="mkfilename_$(date +%s)"
              # Open the file for writing
              exec 3>"$filename"
          fi
      elif $in_code_block; then
          # If we're in a code block, write the line to the file
          echo "$line" >&3
      fi
      ((n++))
  done

  # If we're still in a code block at the end, close the file
  if $in_code_block; then
      exec 3>&-
  fi
}

**Response:**
The main issue with the function is that the code block detection and file writing logic is outside the while loop that reads from stdin. This means that the function will only process the last line of input. Here is the corrected function:

```bash
save_codeblock_to_file() {
  # Initialize variables
  in_code_block=false
  filename=""
  n=1
  # Read from stdin
  while IFS= read -r line; do
    # Check if the line starts a code block
    if [[ $line == \`\`\`* ]]; then
        if $in_code_block; then
            # If we're in a code block, this line ends it
            in_code_block=false
            # Close the file
            exec 3>&-
        else
            # If we're not in a code block, this line starts it
            in_code_block=true
            # Generate a filename
            filename="mkfilename_$(date +%s)"
            # Open the file for writing
            exec 3>"$filename"
        fi
    elif $in_code_block; then
        # If we're in a code block, write the line to the file
        echo "$line" >&3
    fi
    ((n++))
  done

  # If we're still in a code block at the end, close the file
  if $in_code_block; then
      exec 3>&-
  fi
}
```

This function will now correctly process each line of input, detecting the start and end of code blocks and writing the contents of the code blocks to files.
