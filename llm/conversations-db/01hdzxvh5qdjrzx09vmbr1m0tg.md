**Prompt:**
Write a bash terminal command to Why does this find command return many files with wrong filenames?
find "/run/media/thomas/bc9be617-d7f1-4348-9c91-abe485c61dd5/drone" -type f -o -name "2022_09_30__06_34_58" 
Be concise, but include as much code as needed. Do not write anything else. Ever.


**Response:**
The find command you provided is searching for files in the directory "/run/media/thomas/bc9be617-d7f1-4348-9c91-abe485c61dd5/drone" that are either regular files (-type f) or have the name "2022_09_30__06_34_58". 

If this command is returning many files with wrong filenames, it is possible that there are files with similar names or variations of the specified name in the directory. 

To troubleshoot this issue, you can try using the -iname option instead of -name to perform a case-insensitive search. Additionally, you can use wildcards to match patterns in the filename. For example, you can modify the command to:

find "/run/media/thomas/bc9be617-d7f1-4348-9c91-abe485c61dd5/drone" -type f -iname "*2022_09_30__06_34_58*"

This will search for files that contain "2022_09_30__06_34_58" anywhere in their filename, regardless of case.
