**Prompt:**
Can you see why the final find command may be failing?

#!/bin/bash

search_dir="$1"
source_dir="$2"

# Get the list of filenames without extensions from trim_queue directory
filenames=()
while IFS= read -r file; do
    filenames+=("$(basename "$file" | cut -d. -f1)")
done < <(find "$source_dir" -type f)

# Chunk size for each find command
chunk_size=10

# Generate the find query for each chunk
chunks=()
chunk=""
count=0
for filename in "${filenames[@]}"; do
    if [ "$count" -eq "$chunk_size" ]; then
        chunks+=("$chunk")
        chunk=""
        count=0
    fi
    chunk+=" -name \"*$filename*\" -o"
    count=$((count+1))
done

# Add the last chunk to the list
chunks+=("$chunk")

# Execute the find command for each chunk
for chunk in "${chunks[@]}"; do
    query="${chunk:0:-3}"  # Remove the extra -o
    echo ""
#     echo "find $search_dir -type f \( $query \)" # Note: this works when run manually. But the find cmd here fails.
    find "$search_dir" -type f \( $query \)
done

**Response:**
The final find command may be failing because the variable `$query` is not properly quoted when passed as an argument to the find command. This can cause issues if the query contains special characters or spaces.

To fix this, you can modify the last line of the script to properly quote the `$query` variable:

```bash
find "$search_dir" -type f \( "$query" \)
```

This ensures that the query is treated as a single argument and prevents any issues with special characters or spaces.

find: paths must precede expression: ` -name "*2022_09_23__15_51_33*" -o -name "*2022_09_23__15_50_05*" -o -name "*2022_09_23__15_26_15*" -o -name "*2022_09_23__15_22_37*" -o -name "*2022_09_23__15_16_22*" -o -name "*2022_09_23__15_15_10*" -o -name "*2022_09_23__15_07_39*" -o -name "*2022_09_22__18_02_49*"'

**Response:**
I apologize for the confusion. It seems that the issue is with how the `chunks` array is being constructed. The last chunk is not being properly terminated with the `-o` option, resulting in an incomplete find query.

To fix this, you can modify the script as follows:

```bash
# Execute the find command for each chunk
for chunk in "${chunks[@]}"; do
    query="${chunk::-3}"  # Remove the extra -o
    echo ""
    find "$search_dir" -type f \( $query \)
done
```

In this modified script, we are using `${chunk::-3}` to remove the last 3 characters (`-o`) from the chunk, ensuring that the find query is constructed correctly.

I hope this resolves the issue and allows the find command to execute successfully.

The script returned zero results. But when I manually run: find /run/media/thomas/bc9be617-d7f1-4348-9c91-abe485c61dd5/drone -type f \(  -name "*2022_09_23__17_35_31*" -o -name "*2022_09_23__17_33_33*" -o -name "*2022_09_23__17_30_51*" -o -name "*2022_09_23__16_00_55*" -o -name "*2022_09_23__16_00_13*" \) it does return results.

**Response:**
I apologize for the oversight. It appears that there is an issue with how the `chunks` array is being constructed. The `chunk` variable is not being properly reset when a new chunk is started. This causes the query to accumulate all the filenames from the previous chunks, resulting in an incorrect find query.

To fix this issue, you can modify the script as follows:

```bash
# Execute the find command for each chunk
for chunk in "${chunks[@]}"; do
    query="${chunk::-3}"  # Remove the extra -o
    echo ""
    find "$search_dir" -type f \( $query \)
    query=""
done
```

By resetting the `query` variable to an empty string after each iteration, you ensure that each `find` command receives only the appropriate chunk of filenames.

Please try this modified script and let me know if it resolves the issue.
