**Prompt:**
The script returned zero results. But when I manually run that final find line in terminal it does return results.
+#!/bin/bash

search_dir="$1"
source_dir="$2"

# Get the list of filenames without extensions from trim_queue directory
filenames=()
while IFS= read -r file; do
    filenames+=("$(basename "$file" | cut -d. -f1)")
done < <(find "$source_dir" -type f)

# Chunk size for each find command
chunk_size=10

# Generate the find query for each chunk
chunks=()
chunk=""
count=0
for filename in "${filenames[@]}"; do
    if [ "$count" -eq "$chunk_size" ]; then
        chunks+=("$chunk")
        chunk=""
        count=0
    fi
    chunk+=" -name \"*$filename*\" -o"
    count=$((count+1))
done

# Add the last chunk to the list
chunks+=("$chunk")

# Execute the find command for each chunk
for chunk in "${chunks[@]}"; do
    query="${chunk::-3}"  # Remove the extra -o
    find "$search_dir" -type f \( $query \)
done

**Response:**
The issue might be related to the way you're passing the query to the `find` command. When you're constructing the query as a string and then passing it to `find`, it might not be interpreted as you expect.

Instead of constructing the query as a string, consider constructing it as an array. This way, each element of the array will be treated as a separate argument to `find`, which should give you the expected results.

Here's how you can modify your script to use an array for the `find` query:

```bash
#!/bin/bash

search_dir="$1"
source_dir="$2"

# Get the list of filenames without extensions from trim_queue directory
filenames=()
while IFS= read -r file; do
    filenames+=("$(basename "$file" | cut -d. -f1)")
done < <(find "$source_dir" -type f)

# Chunk size for each find command
chunk_size=10

# Generate the find query for each chunk
chunks=()
chunk=()
count=0
for filename in "${filenames[@]}"; do
    if [ "$count" -eq "$chunk_size" ]; then
        chunks+=("${chunk[@]}")
        chunk=()
        count=0
    fi
    chunk+=(-name "*$filename*" -o)
    count=$((count+1))
done

# Add the last chunk to the list
chunks+=("${chunk[@]}")

# Execute the find command for each chunk
for chunk in "${chunks[@]}"; do
    query=("${chunk[@]:0:-1}")  # Remove the extra -o
    find "$search_dir" -type f \( "${query[@]}" \)
done
```

This script should work the same as your original script, but it should correctly handle the `find` query even if it contains spaces or other special characters.
