**Response:**
The error message you're seeing is due to the line `query=("${chunk[@]:0:-1}")`. This line is trying to create a new array `query` from the `chunk` array, but it's trying to start at index 0 and end at index -1. In bash, negative indices count from the end of the array, so an index of -1 refers to the last element of the array. However, the substring expression doesn't allow for a start index that is greater than the end index, which is why you're seeing the error.

To fix this, you can change the line to `query=("${chunk[@]::${#chunk[@]}-1}")`. This will create a new array from the `chunk` array, starting at index 0 and ending at the second-to-last index. This effectively removes the last element from the array, which is what your original line was trying to do. Here's the corrected script:

```bash
#!/bin/bash

search_dir="$1"
source_dir="$2"

# Get the list of filenames without extensions from trim_queue directory
filenames=()
while IFS= read -r file; do
    filenames+=("$(basename "$file" | cut -d. -f1)")
done < <(find "$source_dir" -type f)

# Chunk size for each find command
chunk_size=10

# Generate the find query for each chunk
chunks=()
chunk=()
count=0
for filename in "${filenames[@]}"; do
    if [ "$count" -eq "$chunk_size" ]; then
        chunks+=("${chunk[@]}")
        chunk=()
        count=0
    fi
    chunk+=(-name "*$filename*" -o)
    count=$((count+1))
done

# Add the last chunk to the list
chunks+=("${chunk[@]}")

# Execute the find command for each chunk
for chunk in "${chunks[@]}"; do
    query=("${chunk[@]::${#chunk[@]}-1}")  # Remove the extra -o
    find "$search_dir" -type f \( "${query[@]}" \)
done
