**Prompt:**
Why may dolphin not display video thumbnail previews? I have preview filesize set to unlimited.


**Response:**
There could be several reasons why Dolphin is not displaying video thumbnail previews. Here are some potential causes and solutions:

1. **Thumbnail Generation is Disabled**: Ensure that thumbnail generation is enabled in Dolphin. You can check this by going to `Control` > `Configure Dolphin` > `General` > `Previews` and make sure the `Videos` checkbox is ticked.

2. **Missing Thumbnailer Software**: Dolphin relies on external programs to generate thumbnails for different file types. For videos, it uses FFmpegthumbnailer. Ensure that it is installed on your system. You can install it on Arch Linux with the following command:

   ```
   sudo pacman -S ffmpegthumbnailer
   ```

3. **Incorrect File Permissions**: If the file permissions are incorrect, Dolphin may not be able to generate or display thumbnails. Check the file permissions and ensure that your user has read access.

4. **Corrupted Thumbnail Cache**: If the thumbnail cache is corrupted, it may prevent Dolphin from displaying thumbnails. You can clear the thumbnail cache by deleting the `~/.cache/thumbnails` directory. Note that this will delete all thumbnails, not just video thumbnails.

5. **Unsupported Video Format**: Dolphin may not be able to generate thumbnails for some video formats. If the issue only occurs with certain video files, it may be due to an unsupported format.

If none of these solutions work, it may be worth checking if there are any known issues with your specific version of Dolphin or KDE Plasma.
