**Prompt:**
What is the meaning and origin of the phrase 'flatted seventh degree'?

**Response:**
The phrase "flatted seventh degree" refers to the process of lowering the seventh note of a major scale by a half step (or semitone). In music theory, the seventh degree of a major scale is typically a major seventh interval above the root note. Flattening it means reducing the interval by one half step, making it a minor seventh interval instead.

The origin of this concept lies in the development of Western music and the evolution of different scales and modes. In many traditional and folk musical styles, the flat seventh degree is commonly used as it adds a unique color or "bluesy" flavor to melodies and harmonies. Over time, it became a common musical element in various genres such as blues, jazz, and rock. Today, the flatted seventh degree is widely used in a wide range of musical styles, serving as an essential element in creating different moods and textures.
