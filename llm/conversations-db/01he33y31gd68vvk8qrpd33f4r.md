**Prompt:**
How do I sync my ratings from dolphin to digikam?


**Response:**
To sync your ratings from Dolphin (the file manager) to DigiKam (the photo management application), you can follow these steps:

1. Open Dolphin and navigate to the folder where your photos are stored.
2. Select the photo(s) for which you want to sync the ratings.
3. Right-click and select "Properties" from the context menu.
4. In the properties window, go to the "Comment" tab.
5. Add or modify the rating in the "Rating" field according to your preference. Typically, ratings are stored as a number between 0 and 5.
6. Click "OK" to save the changes.

Now, to sync the ratings with DigiKam:

1. Open DigiKam and go to the library view.
2. Make sure the folder where your photos are located in Dolphin is also added as an album in DigiKam.
3. DigiKam should automatically detect the changes in the folder and update the ratings accordingly. However, if the ratings don't update immediately, you can try manually triggering a rescan of the folder by right-clicking on the album in DigiKam and selecting "Rescan Album" or using the shortcut Ctrl+R.

Note: The sync process between Dolphin and DigiKam relies on DigiKam's automatic file change detection. If you have disabled this feature in DigiKam or the ratings still don't sync for some reason, you might need to manually update the ratings in DigiKam based on your changes in Dolphin.

Keep in mind that this method only syncs basic metadata like ratings. Other features such as tags, labels, and descriptions may not be automatically synced between Dolphin and DigiKam.
