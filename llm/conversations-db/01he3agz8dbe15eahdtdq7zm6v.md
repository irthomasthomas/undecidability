**Prompt:**
Modify the command to view the selected issue using gh issue view: gh issue list -L 5 --state all | fzf -1 -0 | awk '{print }'

**Response:**
To view the selected issue using the `gh issue view` command, modify the provided command as follows:

```shell
gh issue list -L 5 --state all | fzf -1 -0 | awk '{print $1}' | xargs gh issue view
```

In this modified command, the output of the `gh issue list` command is piped into `fzf` to allow for interactive selection of an issue. Then, `awk` is used to extract the first column (issue number) from the selected issue. Finally, `xargs` is used to pass the extracted issue number as an argument to the `gh issue view` command, which will display detailed information about the selected issue.
