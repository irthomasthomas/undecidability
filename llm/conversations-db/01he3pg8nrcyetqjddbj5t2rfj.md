```

The square brackets `[]` enclose the clickable image. Within the square brackets, an exclamation mark `!` indicates that the content is an image. The image source URL is placed within the parentheses immediately after the exclamation mark.

After the closing parentheses of the image source URL, there is another set of square brackets enclosing the clickable link's text ("total stars"). This text is displayed as the alternative text when the image cannot be loaded or for accessibility purposes.

Finally, the link URL is provided within parentheses after the closing square brackets of the clickable link. In this case, it directs to the GitHub repository at the link: `https://github.com/imartinez/privateGPT`.

**Prompt:**
What are some rarer ones but real.

**Response:**
While the badges I previously mentioned are quite common, there are certainly some rarer and more specialized badges that you can create. Here are a few examples:

1. Security Vulnerabilities: Display the number of known security vulnerabilities in the repository.
2. Pull Requests: Display the number of open pull requests in the repository.
3. Downloads: Display the number of times the repository has been downloaded or installed.
4. Release Date: Display the date of the most recent release of the repository.
5. Package Manager Dependencies: Display the number of dependencies the repository has in a specific package manager.
6. Compatibility: Display compatibility information, such as which programming languages or frameworks the repository is compatible with.
7. Code Quality: Display metrics indicating the code quality, like code complexity, maintainability, or static analysis findings.

These rarer badges might be useful for specific scenarios or domains, and their availability might depend on the tools and services you are using to generate badges. In some cases, you may need to create custom badges to display specific information that is relevant to your project.

**Prompt:**
How to do 5?

**Response:**
To create a badge displaying the number of dependencies in a specific package manager, you can use the Shields.io platform. Shields.io allows you to generate custom badges in Markdown format.

1. Determine the package manager you want to display the dependencies for. Examples could include npm, Python's pip, Ruby's Gem, or others.

2. Go to the Shields.io website at https://shields.io/.

3. In the left sidebar, under the "Data" section, click on the "Dependency Status" category.

4. In the right section, you will see various options for different package managers. Choose the one that corresponds to the package manager you want to display dependencies for. For example, if you want to display dependencies using npm, click on the "npm" option.

5. Fill in the necessary details for the badge. You will be asked for the package name or GitHub repo, version information, and optionally, any specific label you want to use for the badge. Fill in the relevant details based on your repository.

6. Once you have filled in the details, you will see a preview of the badge below. You can customize the badge style by selecting different colors and styles.

7. Copy the generated Markdown code displayed under the preview.

8. Paste the copied Markdown code into your repository's README.md or any other markdown file where you want to display the badge.

Note that the specific steps and options might vary depending on the package manager and badge generator you're using, but the general process outlined above should work for most cases.
