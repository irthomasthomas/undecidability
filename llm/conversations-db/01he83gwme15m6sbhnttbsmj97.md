**Prompt:**
How can I get topics and other keywords for a repo using gh cli, or gh api?

**Response:**
To get topics and other keywords for a repository using the GitHub CLI (gh) or GitHub API, you can follow these steps:

Using GitHub CLI (gh):

1. Install the GitHub CLI by following the instructions provided in the GitHub CLI documentation: https://cli.github.com/manual/installation

2. Authenticate with your GitHub account by running the following command and following the prompts:
   ```
   gh auth login
   ```

3. Navigate to the repository for which you want to retrieve topics and keywords.

4. Run the following command to get the repository information, including topics:
   ```
   gh repo view --json topics
   ```

   This command will display the repository information in JSON format, including the topics associated with the repository.

Using GitHub API:

1. Generate a personal access token (PAT) on GitHub. You can follow the instructions provided in the GitHub documentation to create a PAT: https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/keeping-your-account-and-data-secure/creating-a-personal-access-token

2. Make a GET request to the GitHub API endpoint for the repository, including the `topics` media type in the `Accept` header. Replace `<owner>` with the repository owner and `<repo>` with the repository name in the URL:
   ```
   GET /repos/<owner>/<repo> 
   Accept: application/vnd.github.mercy-preview+json
   Authorization: Bearer <PAT>
   ```

   This request will return the repository information, including the topics associated with the repository.

Note: Replace `<owner>` with the actual owner of the repository and `<repo>` with the repository name in the above commands.

Both methods will provide you with the topics and other keywords associated with the repository.
