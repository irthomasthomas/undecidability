**Prompt:**
Write bash to retrieve topics for a given repo

**Response:**
To retrieve topics for a given repository using the GitHub REST API, you can use the following bash script:

```bash
#!/bin/bash

# Set your GitHub username and personal access token
USERNAME="your_username"
TOKEN="your_personal_access_token"

# Set the repository owner and name
OWNER="repository_owner"
REPO="repository_name"

# Make a GET request to the GitHub API to retrieve the topics
response=$(curl -s -H "Authorization: token $TOKEN" \
  "https://api.github.com/repos/$OWNER/$REPO/topics")

# Parse the response to extract the topics
topics=$(echo "$response" | jq -r '.names[]')

# Print the topics
echo "Topics for $OWNER/$REPO:"
for topic in $topics; do
  echo "- $topic"
done
```

Make sure to replace `your_username` and `your_personal_access_token` with your GitHub username and personal access token respectively. Also, update `repository_owner` and `repository_name` with the appropriate values for the repository you want to retrieve topics from.

You will need to have `curl` and `jq` installed on your system to run this script. `curl` is used to make the HTTP request, and `jq` is used to parse the JSON response.

Save the script to a file, e.g., `retrieve_topics.sh`, and make it executable using the command `chmod +x retrieve_topics.sh`. Then, you can run the script by executing `./retrieve_topics.sh` in your terminal. The script will print the topics for the specified repository.
