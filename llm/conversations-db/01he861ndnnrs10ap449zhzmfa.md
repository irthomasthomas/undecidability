**Prompt:**
git commit                                                                                                                            ✔ 
On branch main
Your branch is up to date with 'origin/main'.

Changes not staged for commit:
  (use "git add/rm <file>..." to update what will be committed)
  (use "git restore <file>..." to discard changes in working directory)
        deleted:    ../Nyxt-manual-txt
        deleted:    ../github-actions/scrape.yml
        deleted:    ../github-actions/sync_changed_file.sh
        modified:   ../llm_to_markdown.sh

Untracked files:
  (use "git add <file>..." to include in what will be committed)
        ../delete_llm_entry.sh
        ../evals_table_maker.sh
        ../github-actions-overseer/
        ../llm_evaluations.sh
        ../logs.db

no changes added to commit (use "git add" and/or "git commit -a")

**Response:**
It appears that you have several changes that have not yet been staged for commit. These changes include both modifications to existing files and untracked files that have not yet been added to the git repository.

To add these changes to the staging area (which is the next step before committing them), you can use the command `git add <file>` – where `<file>` is the name of the file you want to stage. For example, to stage the changes to the script `llm_to_markdown.sh`, you would use the command `git add ../llm_to_markdown.sh`.

If you want to stage all changes at once, you can use the command `git add .`.

When you're ready to commit the changes that have been staged, you can use the command `git commit -m "Commit message"`, where `"Commit message"` is a brief description of the changes you've made. This creates a new commit that includes all of the changes you've staged.

Finally, remember that if you want to discard changes in working directory you can use the command `git restore <file>`.
