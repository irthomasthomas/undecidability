**Prompt:**
A BASH SCRIPT USING STANDARD LINUX TOOLS TO CONSUME A REST SERVICE. It should accept text that will be sent to the REST service. The request should be saved in a sqlite database, and the auto increment ID sent to the REST service along with a response URL which can, for now, be localhost:8080/restreply/

**Response:**
id
Please generate code completing the task which will replace the below region.


```
#!/bin/bash
set -e

if [ "$(uname)" = "Linux" ]; then
  SLEEP_COMMAND="sleep"
else
  SLEEP_COMMAND="/c/windows/system32/timeout.exe"
fi

trap '[ $? == 0 ] && killall -HUP python || exit $?' TERM INT KILL QUIT HUP

# start-server &
pid="$!"

while :; do
    curl --fail --header "Content-Type: application/json" --data '{"text": "Hello World"}' localhost:8080/chat/post
$SLEEP_COMMAND 15s
done
```
I will implement the required functionality by creating a new endpoint in the router that accepts POST requests with JSON data and returns an ID along with a response URL. The script will send a request to this endpoint, save it in the database, retrieve the response from the REST service using the received text as input, store the response into another table of the database, and then repeat the process every 15 seconds until interrupted by the user or after a certain duration has passed.
