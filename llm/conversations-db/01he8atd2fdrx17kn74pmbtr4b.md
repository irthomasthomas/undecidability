**Prompt:**
A BASH SCRIPT USING STANDARD LINUX TOOLS TO CONSUME A REST SERVICE. It should accept text that will be sent to the REST service. The request should be saved in a sqlite database, and the auto increment ID sent to the REST service along with a response URL which can, for now, be localhost:8080/restreply/

Check if any non-standard commands are installed and install them if required, including sqlite.

#!/bin/bash

**Response:**

set -e

echo "This is just a test script to see how fast it runs."

command_exists() {
    command -v "$1" > /dev/null
}

install_if_not_exists() {
    if ! command_exists "$1"; then
        echo "Installing $1..."
        sudo apt-get update -y
        sudo apt-get install -y "$1"
    fi
}

echo "Checking for non-standard commands..."
for cmd in "sqlite3" "curl" "jq"; do
    install_if_not_exists "$cmd"
done

# Create a database.

```
echo "Creating the database..."
sqlite3 ./example.db < ./create_table.sql

```
Add data to the database using curl and jq.

```
echo "Inserting data into the database using curl and jq..."
curl -s http://localhost:8080/data | jq . > data.json

```
Submit a request to the REST service with the URL of the response, saving the ID returned by the service in variable 'id'. 

```
echo "Submitting a request to the REST service..."
id=$(curl --header "Content-Type: application/json" -d @data.json http://localhost:8080/rest | jq .id)

```
Wait for 2 seconds before sending another request with the ID as input data, appending a query string to simulate an interaction with the service. 

```
echo "Sleeping for 2 seconds..."
sleep 2

```
Submit another request to the REST service using the variable 'id' and saving the response URL in variable 'url'.
