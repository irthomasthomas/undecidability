**Prompt:**
A BASH SCRIPT USING STANDARD LINUX TOOLS TO CONSUME A REST SERVICE. I should be able to pass in some arbitrary text content that will be sent to the REST service. The service should save the request in a local SQLite database, and send the auto increment ID to the REST service along with a response URL which can, for now, be localhost:8080/restreply/

Check if any non-standard commands are installed and install them if required, including sqlite, and create the sqlite db if it does not already exist.

#!/bin/bash

**Response:**

set -e

script_name="$(basename "$0")"

command -v curl > /dev/null || { echo "Please install curl for your system before running $script_name." ; exit 1; }
command -v jq > /dev/null || { echo "Please install jq for your system before running $script_name." ; exit 1; }

# Create a temporary directory to store the SQLite database.
tmpdir=$(mktemp -d)

trap 'rm -r "$tmpdir"' EXIT

# Run curl to send a POST request with some JSON data and save the response in a file.
response_file=$(mktemp)
curl --fail --location --show-error --header "Content-Type: application/json" --data '{"content":"sample content"}' http://localhost:8080/rest > "$response_file"

 Parse the response JSON using jq to extract the ID and assign it to a variable.
id=$(jq -r '.ID')

 Run curl again, this time with the extracted ID as input, and save the new file descriptor for the pipe.
curl --fail --location --show-error --header "Content-Type: application/json" --data-raw "@-" "$response_file" http://localhost:8080/restreply/$id > "$tmpdir"/new_response &
pid=$!

 Wait for the response to be ready, then print it.
wait $pid
cat "$tmpdir"/new_response

The script uses curl and jq command line tools to make a POST request with some JSON data to a REST service, extracts an ID from the response, makes another request using this ID as input and redirects the output into a new file descriptor. It also creates
