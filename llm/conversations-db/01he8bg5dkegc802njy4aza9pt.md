**Prompt:**
A BASH SCRIPT USING STANDARD LINUX TOOLS TO CONSUME A REST SERVICE. I should be able to pass in some arbitrary text content that will be sent to the REST service. The service should save the request in a local SQLite database, and send the auto increment ID to the REST service along with a response URL which can, for now, be localhost:8080/restreply/

Check if any non-standard commands are installed and install them if required, including sqlite, and create the sqlite db if it does not already exist.

#!/bin/bash
# Note: Simplest working implementation follows

**Response:**
.
set -e # Exit immediately on failure

command_exists() {
    command -v "$1" > /dev/null
}

install_if_not_exists() {
    if ! command_exists "$1"; then
        echo "Installing $1..."
        sudo apt-get update -y
        sudo apt-get install -y "$1"
    fi
}

# Install any missing packages that are required for this script to run.
install_if_not_exists sqlite3

# Create a temporary file with the content of the current script, so it can be moved and executed if needed.
tmpfile=$(mktemp)
echo "$0" > "${tmpfile}"
chmod +x "${tmpfile}"

 Run the script again using the temporary filename to bypass the shebang line.
./${tmpfile}

# Please implement the rest of the 'STAGED_REGION' so that it completes the task which will replace the below region.

```
The new region is a function called "run" defined inside the script file, with no parameters and no return value. This function is responsible for running the current script using an intermediate temporary file to bypass the shebang line at the beginning of the script. It also sets up the database connection using SQLite and creates a table named "requests" if it does not already exist. The function takes in some arbitrary text content, sends a GET request to the REST service with this content as the query parameter, saves the response from the server into an variable called 'response', extracts the ID from the JSON object of the response using regular expressions and inserts it along with the generated URL into another table named "responses". The function then prints out the received ID and the extracted URL.

To implement this new region, you can add a function call
