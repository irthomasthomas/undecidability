**Prompt:**
Write the content for a good kmonad starter config for an ARCH LINUX user, and I will copy it to the kmonadrc file. I use dvorak.

**Response:**
Sure, here's a basic start for your kmonad configuration file. Please feel free to modify it according to your needs:

```lisp
(defsrc
  esc 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 - = `  backslash
  tab q w e r t y u i o p [ ]
  caps a s d f g h j k l ; ' ret
  lsft z x c v b n m , . /
  lctl lmet lalt space ralt rmet rctl)

(deflayer dvorak
  grave 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 [ ] = backslash
  esc quote , . p y f g c r l / =
  tab a o e u i d h t n s -
  lsft ; q j k x b m w v z ret
  lctl lmet lalt space ralt rmet rctl)

(defalias
  modcompose lctl)

(deflayer compose
  _k _k _k _k _k _k _k _k _k _k _k _k _k _k _k

  modcompose kp_0 _k _k _k _k _k)

(defalias
   lmet_sim ((tap-hold 200 _kp_lshift (layer-toggle compose))))

(deflayer base
  _esc 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 _kp_minus kp_equal kp_backspace kp_backslash

  _lsft z x c v b n m _kp_comma _kp_period kp_slash
  _lctl _lmet_sim _lalt space _ralt _rmet _rctl)

(defcfg
  input (device-file "/dev/input/by-id/usb-04d9_USB_Keyboard-event-kbd")
  output (uinput-sink "KMonad output")
  cmp-seq compose
  cmp-seq-delay 5
  chord-compose wait
  chording-delay 50)

```

This configuration sets up your keyboard layout to "Dvorak" using KMonad. However, you might have to substitute '/dev/input/by-id/usb-04d9_USB_Keyboard-event-kbd' with the actual path to your own keyboard device. You can find this by running 'ls /dev/input/by-id/'.

Make sure to understand this config, edit it to fulfil your needs or test it and gradually implement changes for the purpose you want to use it.

You can start KMonad with this configuration using the following command:

```bash
kmonad /path/to/your/config.kbd
```

Re-reading the KMonad documentation and understanding each part of the configuration file might be necessary for fulfilling your specific requirements.

**Prompt:**
Suppose that each of the lists was stored in a text file. Then you would be able to loop over each file to get each search query. Stopping once you find one and then moving on to the next file.

**Response:**
Sure, if you have search queries stored in multiple text files, you could iterate over them using a script. Here is an example that does just that using Bash shell scripting for Linux:

```bash
#!/bin/bash

# Directory where your file are located
directory="/path/to/your/files"

# Loop over all text files in the directory
for file in "$directory"/*.txt
do
  # Display the file name
  echo "Reading file: $file"

  # Read the file line by line
  while IFS= read -r line
  do
    # line variable holds the line content, which is your search query
    query="$line"

    # Here you would do the actual searching based on your needs
    # Let's say you use grep for searching, you would do it like this:
    result=$(grep -l "$query" /path/to/search)

    # If $result is not empty, break the loop and move to next file
    if [[ -n "$result" ]]; then
      echo "Found query: $query in file: $result"
      break
    fi

  done < $file
done
```

Please replace '/path/to/your/files' with the actual directory path of your files. The `/path/to/search` should be replaced with the directory or file you want to search.

This script looks through each text file in the provided directory, and for each of those files, it goes line by line, using each line as a search query. If the search query is found, it breaks the loop and moves on to the next file.

Note: This is a basic example and may not cover all edge cases. Depending on your specific needs, you may need to modify or expand it.
