**Prompt:**
Write the content for a good kmonad starter config for an ARCH LINUX user, and I will copy it to the kmonadrc file

**Response:**
Here is a basic starter configuration for KMonad on Arch Linux. Make sure to adjust it according to your needs.

```shell
(defcfg
  ;; For Linux users
  input  (device-file "/dev/input/by-id/usb-device-name-event-kbd")
  output (uinput-sink "My KMonad output")

  ;; Use this layout -- adjust according to your preference
  layout (us)
)

(defsrc
  LC-RC LS-SP RC-ENT RS-SP
  LS-C    LCTL                   RET

  F1    F2  F3  F4  F5  F6  INSERT HOME PGUP
  TAB   Q   W   E   R   T   DELETE END  PGDN
  CAPS  A   S   D   F   G
  LSFT  Z   X   C   V   B
  LALT  ESC GRAVE 1   2   3   4     5     6
)

(deflayer qwerty
  LC-RC LS-SP RC-ENT RS-SP
  LS-C    LCTL                 RF-SP

  F1    F2  F3  F4  F5  F6  INSERT HOME PGUP
  TAB   Q   W   E   R   T   DELETE END  PGDN
  CAPS  A   S   D   F   G
  LSFT  Z   X   C   V   B
  LALT  ESC 1     2   3   4   5     6     7
)
```

Here is what you need to adjust accordingly:

1. In the `defcfg` block, replace the `/dev/input/by-id/usb-device-name-event-kbd` with the path to the event device you want to handle. You can check this with a command like `ls /dev/input/by-id/`.

2. In the `defsrc` block, the keys are split into four parts: left control, left shift, right control, right shift. These are corresponding to the physical keys on your keyboard. Adjust it to your keyboard layout.

3. The layout being used (`deflayer qwerty`) in this example is QWERTY. If you want to use another layout, adjust this block accordingly. 

4. Every key binding can be customized. 

Please refer to [KMonad Documentation](https://github.com/kmonad/kmonad/blob/master/doc/getting_started.md) to get advanced help and understand each component in deeper. Remember to restart your kmonad execution for the file after making changes.
