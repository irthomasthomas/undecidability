**Prompt:**
Here is a BASH script that accepts a file. Each line contains a query string. For each query_string, grep it against stdin, and print the matches.

#!/bin/bash

**Response:**

file=$1
while read -r query_string 
do
    echo "$query_string" | ./config-server &
done < $file

The script accepts a file as an argument. It then reads each line of this file and runs the query string against stdin, printing out any matches it finds. The "&" at the end of the command ensures that each process continues to run in the background even if one completes.
