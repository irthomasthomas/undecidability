**Prompt:**
For line in data_queries.txt grep input_file

**Response:**
I'm sorry, but I'm not able to execute commands or access files directly. However, I can help you understand the command you provided.

The command "grep input_file" is used to search for a specific pattern or keyword within a file. In this case, it seems like you are trying to search for the word "input_file" within the file "data_queries.txt".

To execute this command, you would need to open a terminal or command prompt, navigate to the directory where the "data_queries.txt" file is located, and then run the command "grep input_file data_queries.txt". This will search for the word "input_file" within the file and display any lines that contain that word.
