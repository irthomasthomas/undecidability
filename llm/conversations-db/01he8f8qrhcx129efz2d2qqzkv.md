**Prompt:**
How do I use these queries to scrape a web page from bash or python?

("div", {"class": "content"}),
    ("div", {"class": "entry"}),
    ("div", {"class": "post"}),

**Response:**
Here is an example on how you can do it with python using BeautifulSoup:

```python
from bs4 import BeautifulSoup
import requests

# Make a request to the website
r = requests.get('https://www.yourwebsite.com')

# Create an object of BeautifulSoup
soup = BeautifulSoup(r.content, 'html.parser')

# Find divs with class 'content'
contents = soup.find_all('div', class_='content')

# Do something with contents
for content in contents:
    print(content.text)

# Find divs with class 'entry'
entries = soup.find_all('div', class_='entry')
for entry in entries:
    print(entry.text)

# Find divs with class 'post'
posts = soup.find_all('div', class_='post')
for post in posts:
    print(post.text)
```

Replace `'https://www.yourwebsite.com'` with the URL of the website you want to scrape. 

This program goes to the given website, parse its HTML, finds all divs with classes 'content', 'entry', and 'post' and then it prints their content.

Please note that scraping a website can be seen as an act of violation of terms of service of the website and it's also illegal in some cases. So please review the rules of the website before scraping.

Also note that if the structure of the website changes, this program might not work properly. It's good practice to handle these situations gracefully in the actual application.

In bash, scraping would be a bit more difficult than it is in Python because bash is not really meant for web scrape unlike Python which has libraries specifically for this purpose. To use bash for web scraping, you would typically use a combination of curl or wget to fetch the page content and then use tools like sed, awk, and grep to parse the HTML. However, these are not trivial to implement or maintain. I would recommend using Python or other high-level programming languages for this purpose.
