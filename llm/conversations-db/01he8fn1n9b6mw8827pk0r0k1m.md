**Prompt:**
Explain this:

# Tags and attributes to search for in the HTML response to find the article url
URL_QUERIES = [
    ("a", {"class": "story-link"}),
    ("a", {"class": "headline"}),
    ("a", {"class": "title"}),
    ("a", {"class": "entry-title"}),
    ("a", {"class": "post-title"}),
    ("a", {"class": "blog-post-title"}),
    ("a", {"class": "article-title"}),
    ("a", {"class": "entry-title"}),
    ("a", {"class": "post-title"}),
    ("a", {"class": "blog-post-title"}),
    ("a", {"class": "article-title"}),
    ("a", {"class": "entry-title"}),
    ("a", {"class": "review-title"}),
]

**Response:**
This list contains multiple tuples, each representing a tag and attribute pair to search for in an HTML document. This is typically used for web scraping - the process of extracting data from websites. 

In this specific example, these tuples are being used to find certain `a` tags (which define hyperlinks) in the HTML response of a web page. The `a` tag is often used to mark elements that link to other pages. Each tuple is describing a different class attribute that could potentially contain the URL of an article on a web page.

For example, the tuple `("a", {"class": "story-link"})` would search for `a` elements in the HTML response where the class attribute is "story-link", a common class used to define links to articles on news websites. The resulting elements from this search would likely contain the URL for a particular article on a page.

This script would be useful for a web scraping task that involves gathering article URLs from various different websites, as different websites may use different class names for their article links. It thus allows for a more universal scraping approach, targetting common class names used for article links across various webites.

**Prompt:**
Write the script that consumes this.

**Response:**
This is how you might use the `URL_QUERIES` array inside a web scraping script, with the help of a Python library called BeautifulSoup:

```python
import requests
from bs4 import BeautifulSoup

URL_QUERIES = [
    ("a", {"class": "story-link"}),
    ("a", {"class": "headline"}),
    ("a", {"class": "title"}),
    ("a", {"class": "entry-title"}),
    ("a", {"class": "post-title"}),
    ("a", {"class": "blog-post-title"}),
    ("a", {"class": "article-title"}),
    ("a", {"class": "entry-title"}),
    ("a", {"class": "post-title"}),
    ("a", {"class": "blog-post-title"}),
    ("a", {"class": "article-title"}),
    ("a", {"class": "entry-title"}),
    ("a", {"class": "review-title"}),
]

def get_article_urls(url):
    response = requests.get(url)
    soup = BeautifulSoup(response.content, 'html.parser')
    urls = []
    for query in URL_QUERIES:
        elements = soup.find_all(query[0], attrs=query[1])
        for element in elements:
            urls.append(element.get('href'))
    return urls

# test the function
print(get_article_urls('https://example.com'))
```

In this script, `get_article_urls()` is a function that takes a website URL, sends a GET request to it, and parses the HTML response using BeautifulSoup. It then iterates over each query in `URL_QUERIES`, using them to find all `a` elements with the given class attribute. For each found element, it fetches the 'href' attribute, which typically contains the URL of the linked article, and appends it to the `urls` list. The function finally returns this list, giving us all article URLs found on the page.

**Prompt:**
Make a javascript document.querySelectorAll

**Response:**
Below is how you can use `document.querySelectorAll` in JavaScript to select elements with similar tags as in the Python script.

```javascript
var URL_QUERIES = [
    "a.story-link",
    "a.headline",
    "a.title",
    "a.entry-title",
    "a.post-title",
    "a.blog-post-title",
    "a.article-title",
    "a.entry-title",
    "a.review-title",
];

function getArticleUrls() {
    var urls = [];
    URL_QUERIES.forEach(function(query){
        var elements = document.querySelectorAll(query);
        elements.forEach(function(element){
            urls.push(element.href);
        });
    });
    return urls;
}

console.log(getArticleUrls());
```

In JavaScript, `document.querySelectorAll` method returns a static NodeList representing a list of the document's elements that match the specified group of selectors. 

It's worth mentioning that you would use this script in the console of your browser when you're on the page that you'd like to select the elements from because this script is executed in the client side.
