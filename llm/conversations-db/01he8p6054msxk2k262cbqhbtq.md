**Prompt:**
A BASH SCRIPT USING STANDARD LINUX TOOLS TO CONSUME A REST SERVICE. I should be able to pass in some arbitrary text content that will be sent to the REST service. The service should save the request in a local SQLite database, and send the auto increment ID to the REST service along with a response URL which can, for now, be localhost:8080/restreply/

Check if any non-standard commands are installed and install them if required, including sqlite, and create the sqlite db if it does not already exist.

#!/bin/bash
# Note: Simplest working implementation follows

**Response:**
...

echo "Hello World" > /tmp/test.txt  # write a file to disk for later retrieval by curl or wget


curl -i --data-binary @/tmp/test.txt http://localhost:8080/restservice/123456789?responseurl=http%3A//localhost%3A8080/restreply/%d  # POST the file to rest service
