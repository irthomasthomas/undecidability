**Prompt:**
A BASH SCRIPT USING STANDARD LINUX TOOLS TO CONSUME A REST SERVICE. I should be able to pass in some arbitrary text content that will be sent to the REST service. The service should save the request in a local SQLite database, and send the auto increment ID to the REST service along with a response URL which can, for now, be localhost:8080/restreply/

Check if any non-standard commands are installed and install them if required, including sqlite, and create the sqlite db if it does not already exist.

#!/bin/bash


**Response:**

 #              This script is intended as an example of how to consume data from 
 #              a restful API. It should work on any linux system that has curl and sqlite3 installed by default (ie most modern Linux distros).  I am using the free version of SQLite which can be found here: https://www.sqlite.org/download.html
