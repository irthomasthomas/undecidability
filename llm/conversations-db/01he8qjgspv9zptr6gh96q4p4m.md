**Prompt:**
A BASH SCRIPT USING STANDARD LINUX TOOLS TO CONSUME A REST SERVICE. I should be able to pass in some arbitrary text content that will be sent to the REST service. The service should save the request in a local SQLite database, and send the auto increment ID to the REST service along with a response URL which can, for now, be localhost:8080/restreply/

Check if any non-standard commands are installed and install them if required, including sqlite, and create the sqlite db if it does not already exist.

#!/bin/bash
