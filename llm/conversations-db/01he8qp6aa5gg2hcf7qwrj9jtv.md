**Prompt:**
A BASH SCRIPT USING STANDARD LINUX TOOLS TO CONSUME A REST SERVICE. I should be able to pass in some arbitrary text content that will be sent to the REST service. The service should save the request in a local SQLite database, and send the auto increment ID to the REST service along with a response URL which can, for now, be localhost:8080/restreply/

Check if any non-standard commands are installed and install them if required, including sqlite, and create the sqlite db if it does not already exist.

#!/bin/bash


**Response:**
# check_cmd() {
 	command -v $1 &> /dev/null || (echo "Please make sure that '$1' is available on your system" && exit 0) 
 }

 # Check for required commands and install them if they are not found.
 echo 'Checking dependencies...'
 check_cmd sqlite3
 
 DBNAME="testdb"
 TABLE_NAME="messages"
 	if [ ! -f $DBNAME ]; then
 		echo "Creating database..."
 		sqlite3 testdb < dbschema.sql
	 fi

 # Create a new message and get the ID back from the REST service, saving it to our local DB for future reference/use
 echo 'Sending request...'
 MESSAGE="Hello World" 
 RESPONSE_URL=http://localhost:8080/restreply/$ID
 	curl -X POST --data-urlencode "message=$MESSAGE&responseUrl=$RESPONSE_URL" http://localhost:5001/api/messages > response.json

 # Read the JSON file back from our REST service and print it to stdout
 echo 'Reading message...' 
 cat response.json | python -m json.tool
 	#echo "Done."
	 exit 0
