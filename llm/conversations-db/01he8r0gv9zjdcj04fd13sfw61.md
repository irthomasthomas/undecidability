**Response:**
Your system is correctly identifying two different graphics cards:

1. NVIDIA GeForce GTX 1080 - This card is using the nvidia driver. This is likely your primary graphics card and is used for your system's display.

2. NVIDIA GeForce RTX 3060 Lite Hash Rate - This card is also using the nvidia driver. This might be used for tasks that require a lot of computing power, such as 3D rendering or machine learning.

In addition, it's also identifying an integrated high definition audio controller on your GTX 1080, which is being managed by the snd_hda_intel driver.

**Prompt:**
is there a reason the second gpu has no kernel modules?

**Response:**
The output shows that the second GPU (NVIDIA GeForce RTX 3060 Lite Hash Rate) is currently using the nvidia driver, but it doesn't list any kernel modules for it. 

There is no explicit reason provided by the output. However, it doesn't necessarily mean there is something wrong. It doesn't always show all the information. It's very likely that this GPU is using the same kernel modules as the first one: nouveau, nvidia_drm, nvidia.

If you're not encountering any issues while using your system or during tasks that involve the second GPU, it's likely that everything is fine. If you want to be certain that suitable kernel modules are loaded you could investigate further with other Linux utilities like `lsmod` or checking within `/lib/modules/$(uname -r)/kernel/drivers/`.

**Prompt:**
Can I test the second gpu specifically? Using mpv for example?

**Response:**
Yes, you can specify which GPU mpv should use for video decoding based on the index.

For NVIDIA CUDA GPU, you need to set the `--cuda-decoder` option. It expects to receive as its argument the index of the GPU to use for decoding.

For VDPAU (Video Decode and Presentation API for Unix), you need to set the `--vo` option to `vdpau` and the `--vdpau` option to `device=<index>`.

Example to use with the second GPU:

1. For CUDA:
```sh
mpv --cuda-decoder=1 <filename>
```
2. For VDPAU:
```sh
mpv --vo=vdpau --vdpau-device=1 <filename>
```

But note, you might need to adjust index number because it might not correlate with your `lspci` output.

Please keep in your mind, not all type of media files you can decode using GPU.

Additionally, you could use 'nvidia-smi' or 'nvidia-settings' command to monitor GPU usage and temperature, thus you can see if the 2nd GPU is being processing the video.
