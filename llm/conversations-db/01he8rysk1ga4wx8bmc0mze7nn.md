**Prompt:**
pipe nvidia-smi dmon to something to plot or visualize in arch console

**Response:**
To pipe the output of `nvidia-smi dmon` to plot or visualize in Arch console, you can use various command-line tools. One popular tool is `gnuplot`. Here's an example of how you can use it:

1. Install `gnuplot` if it's not already installed on your system:
   ```
   sudo pacman -Sy gnuplot
   ```

2. Run the following command to continuously monitor `nvidia-smi dmon` and plot the data using `gnuplot`:
   ```
   nvidia-smi dmon -s u | gnuplot -e "plot '-' using 2 with lines"
   ```

The command `nvidia-smi dmon -s u` generates GPU utilization information, which is then piped to `gnuplot` for visualization. The `gnuplot` command `-e "plot '-' using 2 with lines"` tells `gnuplot` to plot the data received from the pipeline as lines. You can customize the plot appearance and options based on your requirements.

Note that `gnuplot` will open a new window to display the plot. If you want to plot directly in the Arch console, you can use a different tool like `spark` or `termgraph`. However, these tools are generally more suitable for simpler visualizations like bar charts or sparklines.
