**Prompt:**
In arch linux my second nvidia gpu seems to not be getting used according to nvidia-smi dmon --id 1

**Response:**
If your second NVIDIA GPU is not getting used according to the `nvidia-smi dmon --id 1` command, it could be due to a few reasons. Here are some steps you can follow to troubleshoot the issue:

1. Make sure the NVIDIA drivers are properly installed for both GPUs. Check if both GPUs are recognized by running the command `nvidia-smi`.

2. Ensure that the display is connected to the second GPU and that it is configured to output the display. You can check the display configuration by using the `xrandr` command.

3. Verify that the application you are testing with is configured to use the second GPU. Not all applications are designed to use multiple GPUs by default. Some applications may require additional configuration to utilize the second GPU.

4. Check if any specific environment variables or flags need to be set to enable the use of multiple GPUs. Some applications have options to enable or select the specific GPU to be used.

5. Ensure that the SLI (Scalable Link Interface) or multi-GPU settings are configured correctly. Sometimes, SLI or multi-GPU settings may need to be enabled in the BIOS or in the NVIDIA control panel.

6. If you have multiple GPUs of different architectures (e.g., one GPU is NVIDIA Pascal while the other is NVIDIA Turing), it's worth checking if the application you are using is compatible with both architectures. Some applications might only support a specific GPU architecture.

7. Finally, you can try reseating the second GPU in its slot or testing it in a different PCIe slot to rule out any hardware issues.

If none of the above steps resolve the issue, you may need to seek further assistance from the Arch Linux community or the NVIDIA support forums for more specific troubleshooting steps.
