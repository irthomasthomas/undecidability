**Prompt:**
Speculate why does mpv player on arch saturate my cpu before my two nvidia gpus when playing multiple videos? What are the next steps to diagnose?

**Response:**
MPV Player is probably utilizing the CPU for video decoding and rendering processes due to its default settings. It might not be configured to use hardware acceleration provided by NVIDIA GPUs. 

The reason for using CPU instead of GPU could be either a lack of necessary drivers or MPV's configuration: it doesn't know it should leverage the GPUs for decoding and rendering. 

To diagnose:

1. Ensure drivers for your Nvidia GPUs are correctly installed and updated. You can use the 'nvidia-smi' command to check the status of your GPUs. If they are not installed, you should install them from the official NVIDIA website or via your package manager in Arch.

2. Check if hardware acceleration is enabled in MPV player. If it doesn't, you can enable it by providing the correct options (like --hwdec=cuda or --hwdec=vdpau) in the configuration file or directly in the command line. If you are using VO/VAAPI or similar, check if your drivers and libraries are correctly installed and working.

3. Use 'htop', 'top' or a similar system monitoring application to identify the CPU usage while playing videos. Single-threaded tasks might be maxing out one of your cores, causing CPU saturation.

4. Monitor GPU usage while playing videos to see if they're used at all.

5. Review the output of MPV player in the terminal for any errors related to video decoding and rendering.

If the above steps do not solve your issue, consider seeking help from the user community, your hardware manufacturer, or the software's creator. Provide the gathered diagnostics and detailed insights into your configuration.
