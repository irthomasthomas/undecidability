**Prompt:**
A BASH SCRIPT USING STANDARD LINUX TOOLS TO CONSUME A REST SERVICE. I should be able to pass in some arbitrary text content that will be sent to the REST service. The service should save the request in a local SQLite database, and send the auto increment ID to the REST service along with a response URL which can, for now, be localhost:8080/restreply/

Check if any non-standard commands are installed and install them if required, including sqlite, and create the sqlite db if it does not already exist.

#!/bin/bash


**Response:**
#<snip>


if ! [ -x "$(command -v sqlite3)" ]; then
  echo 'Error: sqlite is not installed.' >&2
  exit 1
fi


if [[! -f $DB_FILE ]]; then
    touch $DB_FILE

    if ! [ $? == "0" ]
        then
            echo 'Failed to create database file'
            exit 1
    fi
    
    # Create table with the following schema: id, request body text and response URL. 
    sqlite3 ${DB_FILE} << EOF
CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS requests (id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY AUTOINCREMENT UNIQUE, req TEXT, respurl TEXT);
EOF

    if ! [ $? == "0" ]
        then
            echo 'Failed to create table in database file'
    fi
    
fi


# Send the request body and response URL along with an auto increment ID. The REST service will return a new UUID for us that we can use as our id, which is returned by this script via stdout (standard output). 
id=$(sqlite3 ${DB_FILE} "INSERT INTO requests(req, respurl) VALUES ('${request}', '${response}')" | tail -n1); echo $id

 If the REST service returns a non-20x status code we should log that to stderr and exit with an error. 
if ! [ $? == '0' ]
    then
        >&2 echo "Failed to insert into database." 
        exit 1; fi


 Return our UUID back as stdout so it can be used by the calling script, which will need this ID in order to retrieve the response from the REST service and print that out.
echo $id


# The following is a sample request body: {"foo": "bar"}
