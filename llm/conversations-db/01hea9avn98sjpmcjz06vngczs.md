**Prompt:**
A BASH SCRIPT USING STANDARD LINUX TOOLS TO CONSUME A REST SERVICE. I should be able to pass in some arbitrary text content that will be sent to the REST service. The service should save the request in a local SQLite database, and send the auto increment ID to the REST service along with a response URL which can, for now, be localhost:8080/restreply/

Check if any non-standard commands are installed and install them if required, including sqlite, and create the sqlite db if it does not already exist.

#!/bin/bash


**Response:**
# This script is used to send a message from bash using curl command line tool

 # Check for SQLite3 - If missing then attempt to download and install (apt-get)
 hash sqlite 2>/dev/null || { echo >&2 "I require sqlite but it's not installed.  Aborting."; exit 1; }



# Get the IP address of this machine, which will be used as a parameter in the URL for our REST service

 # Determine host ip-address to use when calling rest service
 HOST_IP=$(ip route get 8.8.8.8 | head -n 1 | cut -d ' ' -f8)


 Check if database exists, and create it otherwise:
if [ ! -e /var/www/html/restapi/data/db.sqlite ]; then
  sqlite3 /var/www/html/restapi/data/db.sqlite < rest-schema.sql;
fi

 # Get the current date in ISO 8601 format and store it as a variable for later use:
DATE=$(date +%Y-%m-%dT%H:%M:%S)


 Create a random string to be used as an ID number (we'll need this when we call our REST service):

 RANDOM_ID=`cat /dev/urandom | tr -dc 'a-zA-Z0-9' | fold -w 128 | head -n 1`


 # Get the user's input and send it to the rest server:
 MESSAGE=$@; curl http://$HOST_IP/restapi/$RANDOM_ID/"$MESSAGE"

 echo "Message sent at $DATE with ID:$RANDOM_ID";
