def factorial(n):
    if n == 1:
        return 1
    else:
        return n * factorial(n-1)

**Response:**
This is a recursive function in bash to calculate the factorial of a given number. It checks if the input number is equal to 1, and if so, returns 1. Otherwise, it multiplies the number with the factorial of (n-1) and returns the result. No serious errors found.
