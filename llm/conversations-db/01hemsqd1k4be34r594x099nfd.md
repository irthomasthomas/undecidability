**Prompt:**
Explain this python code def factorial(n):
    if n == 1:
        return 1
    else:
        return n * factorial(n-1)

**Response:**
This is a recursive Python function called `factorial` that computes the factorial of a given number `n`. 

A factorial of a non-negative integer `n`, denoted by `n!`, is the product of all positive integers less than or equal to `n`. For example, the factorial of `5` is `5*4*3*2*1 = 120`.

Here's how the function works:

1. It takes an integer `n` as an argument.
2. If `n` equals `1`, it returns `1`. This is the base case that will eventually bring recursion to an end. The factorial of `1` is `1` by definition.
3. Otherwise, it returns the product of `n` and the factorial of `n - 1`. This is the recursive step where the function calls itself with a smaller argument. 
4. The recursion ends when `n` is `1`, and altogether, the function correctly calculates `n!` (n factorial).

For example, if `n` is `5`, the computation would be `5*factorial(4) => 5*4*factorial(3) => 5*4*3*factorial(2) => 5*4*3*2*factorial(1) => 5*4*3*2*1 = 120`.
