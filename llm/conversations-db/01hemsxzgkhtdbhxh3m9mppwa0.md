**Prompt:**
Explain how this python code works:

def factorial(n):
    if n == 1:
        return 1
    else:
        return n * factorial(n-1)

**Response:**
This python code performs the task of computing the factorial of a number. It is programmed using the principle of recursion.

Here's how it works:

1. The `factorial` function takes an integer `n` as an argument.

2. It first checks if `n` is equal to 1. If it is, the function returns `1`. This is the base case of the recursion.

3. If `n` is not equal to 1, it means `n` is greater than `1`. So, the code calls the same function `factorial(n-1)` again within the function but with the argument as `n-1`, and multiplies the result with `n`. The recursion continues until `n` becomes `1`.

For example, suppose you call the function with `n` as `5`. The calculation happens as follows:

factorial(5) -> 5 * factorial(4)
factorial(4) -> 4 * factorial(3)
factorial(3) -> 3 * factorial(2)
factorial(2) -> 2 * factorial(1)

At this point, `n` is equal to `1`, so the function just returns `1`.

Therefore, the calculation becomes:

factorial(5) -> 5 * 4 * 3 * 2 * 1 -> 120

So, the factorial of `5` is `120`.

This way, by using recursion (a function calling itself), the code is able to easily calculate the factorial of a given number.

**Prompt:**
What does -> mean?

**Response:**
In the given context, the "->" arrow used in the explanation doesn't have a syntactical meaning in Python. It's being used just as a representation in the contextual explanation to describe the flow of execution or transformation.

However, in Python 3.5 and later versions, "->" does have a syntax-specific use where it denotes the expected return type of a function definitions. This is part of 'type hinting'.

For example, in the function,

def greet(name: str) -> str:
    return 'Hello, ' + name

Here the "-> str" signifies that the function is expected to return a string. This is just a hint and Python will not enforce this return type, because Python is dynamically-typed. But this can help developers understand what a function is supposed to return.

**Prompt:**
Write the function without using recursion

**Response:**
Sure, the factorial of a number can be computed without recursion through a simple iterative function as follows:

```python
def factorial(n):
    result = 1
    for i in range(1, n + 1):
        result *= i
    return result
```
With this function, you create a variable `result` and set it to 1. Then you start a loop ranging from 1 to `n` (inclusive). In each loop iteration, you multiply `result` by the current loop index `i`. By the end of the loop, `result` will hold the factorial of `n`.

This is an iterative solution to find the factorial of a number and it's an alternative to the recursive solution provided in the original code.

**Prompt:**
how can execute that from the terminal without writing a py file?

**Response:**
You can execute Python code directly from the terminal without creating a Python file using the `-c` option. 
Here is how you can execute the factorial function for a number, say `5`, from the terminal:

```bash
python -c "def factorial(n): result = 1; [result := result * i for i in range(1, n+1)]; print(result)" -c "factorial(5)"
```

Python interpreter executes Python code that follows as a part of `-c` command.  

Note that the syntax `[result := result * i for i in range(1, n+1)]` is used here. This is an assignment expression or walrus operator introduced in Python 3.8. It assigns `result * i` to `result` for each `i` in `range(1, n+1)`.

Also note that the `-c` option should be given before each command you want to execute. After defining the function, you have to give `-c` again to call the function.

**Prompt:**
that gave no output

**Response:**
I apologize for the confusion, the provided command does not correctly call the factorial function. In order to call the function in an interactive terminal with the `-c` flag, you need to define and call the function within the same command string. 

With the corrected command, you would input the following into your terminal:

```bash
python -c "def factorial(n): result = 1; [result := result * i for i in range(1, n+1)]; print(factorial(5))"
```

You can replace the `5` in `print(factorial(5))` with whichever number you wish to calculate the factorial for.
