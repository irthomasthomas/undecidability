**Prompt:**
March 2023: Installing pytorch with gpu support in arch linux. In terminal



**Response:**
To install PyTorch with GPU support on Arch Linux, you'll need to ensure that you have the NVIDIA drivers and CUDA toolkit installed. Here's a step-by-step guide to installing PyTorch with GPU support:

1. **Update Your System:**
   Make sure your system is up to date by running:
   ```bash
   sudo pacman -Syu
   ```

2. **Install NVIDIA Drivers:**
   If you haven't already installed the NVIDIA drivers, you can do so by running:
   ```bash
   sudo pacman -S nvidia nvidia-utils
   ```

3. **Install CUDA Toolkit:**
   Install the CUDA toolkit from the official Arch Linux repositories:
   ```bash
   sudo pacman -S cuda
   ```

4. **Install cuDNN (Optional):**
   For deep learning tasks, you might also need NVIDIA's cuDNN library. You can install it from the AUR (Arch User Repository) using an AUR helper like `yay` or `paru`. If you don't have an AUR helper, you can install one first. For example, to install `yay`:
   ```bash
   sudo pacman -S --needed git base-devel
   git clone https://aur.archlinux.org/yay.git
   cd yay
   makepkg -si
   ```
   Then, install cuDNN:
   ```bash
   yay -S cudnn
   ```

5. **Install PyTorch:**
   You can install PyTorch with GPU support via `pip`. First, ensure you have Python and `pip` installed:
   ```bash
   sudo pacman -S python python-pip
   ```
   Then, install PyTorch using `pip`. It's recommended to do this within a virtual environment to avoid conflicts with system packages. Here's how to create a virtual environment and install PyTorch:
   ```bash
   python -m venv myenv
   source myenv/bin/activate
   pip install torch torchvision torchaudio --extra-index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cu116
   ```
   Replace `cu116` with the version that matches your CUDA toolkit version (e.g., `cu113` for CUDA 11.3).

6. **Verify Installation:**
   To verify that PyTorch has been installed correctly and can access the GPU, you can run the following Python code:
   ```python
   import torch
   print(torch.cuda.is_available())
   ```
   If it prints `True`, then PyTorch is able to use your GPU.

Remember that CUDA versions must be compatible with the version of PyTorch you are installing. Check the PyTorch website for the compatible CUDA version for the PyTorch release you want to install.

Please note that the steps above assume you have an NVIDIA GPU that is compatible with the latest drivers and CUDA toolkit. If you have an older GPU, you may need to install legacy drivers and an older version of CUDA that is compatible with your hardware.
