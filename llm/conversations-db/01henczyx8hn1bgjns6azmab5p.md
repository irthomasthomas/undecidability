**Prompt:**
Command to produce embeddings against '/home/thomas/.config/io.datasette.llm/logs.db' using -m jina-embeddings-v2-base-en

**Response:**
To obtain embeddings from a database like the one you mentioned (`/home/thomas/.config/io.datasette.llm/logs.db`) using the Jina AI model `-m jina-embeddings-v2-base-en`, you would typically need a command that bridges between the use of the database and the machine learning model.

Now, it is important to clarify that as of my knowledge cutoff in early 2023, there is no direct command that could specifically apply to your scenario without additional context or software.

However, if you want to obtain embeddings from text data stored in your SQLite database using the Jina AI model, you can follow this general approach:

1. **Install Jina** (if you haven't done so yet), but make sure you refer to the latest documentation as there might be changes:
```bash
pip install jina
```

2. **Extract Data from SQLite**: This step requires you to extract the text data from your SQLite database that you want to encode into embeddings.

3. **Using Jina to Extract Embeddings**: The following is a conceptual example in Python, showing how you might use Jina to get embeddings from text.

```python
from jina import Client
from docarray import Document

client = Client(protocol='http', port='host:port') # Specify the actual host and port if you are using a Jina server

# Assuming you have a list of texts extracted from the SQLite database
texts = ['your', 'list', 'of', 'texts', 'extracted', 'from', 'database']

# Convert texts to Document format expected by Jina
documents = [Document(text=text) for text in texts]

# Send the documents for embedding
embedded_docs = client.embed(documents, parameters={'model': 'jina-embeddings-v2-base-en'})

# The `embedded_docs` now contains the same documents with an 'embedding' field now filled
for doc in embedded_docs:
    print(doc.embedding) # This will print the embedding of each text
```

Please replace `'your', 'list', 'of', 'texts', 'extracted', 'from', 'database'` with an actual list of strings you wish to encode. Also, fill in the actual host and port if you are using a Jina server, or use `jina.flow` if you are using a local Flow in Jina.

4. **Store Embeddings**: Once you have the embeddings, you will then need to store them back into your `logs.db` or wherever is appropriate, which would typically require another step using SQLite commands.

Remember to check the current Jina documentation for the specific version you are using, as the API might have changed after my last update. The above example presumes a Jina server is running and is reachable at 'host:port'. If such a server is not set up, you'll need to use a Jina `Flow` to deploy the model locally and then call the `embed` method, which will be different from the above client example.
