**Prompt:**
Break, break, break on thy cold grey stones oh sea.
And I would that my tongue could utter 
The thoughts that arise in 

**Response:**
me.
O’er the endless waves, how they crash and flow,
But words fail to capture the depths below.

Break, break, break, with your relentless might,
As you erode the cliffs, day and night.
Oh sea, if I could speak my inner truth,
I’d reveal the dreams of my vanquished youth.

The sun may shine upon thy sparkling waves,
But within my heart, there lie hidden caves.
Emotions trapped like sailors lost at sea,
Longing for release, yearning to be free.

Break, break, break, on thy cold grey stones,
My silence echoes amidst your mournful moans.
If only I could find the words to express,
The weight of my sorrow, this profound distress.

But alas, the sea remains unchanged and vast,
Its relentless power forever steadfast.
So I shall stand in silence, amidst the spray,
And let the ocean speak for me, as I pray.
