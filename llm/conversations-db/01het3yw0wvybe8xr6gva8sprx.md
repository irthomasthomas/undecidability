**Response:**
It seems like you're trying to create a shell function that opens the Kate text editor at a specific line where a keyword is found within a file. However, there's an issue with the command substitution and the use of `which` to find the `timer` command. Also, the `open_kate_at_line` function is not being called correctly.

Here's a corrected version of the function and how to call it:

```bash
open_kate_at_line () {
    local keyword=$1 
    local file_pattern=$2 
    echo "keyword: $keyword"
    echo "file_pattern: $file_pattern"
    local grep_result=$(grep --with-filename --line-number "$keyword" "$file_pattern") 
    echo "grep_result: $grep_result"
    if [[ -n $grep_result ]]
    then
        local file_path=$(echo "$grep_result" | awk -F: '{print $1}') 
        local line_number=$(echo "$grep_result" | awk -F: '{print $2}') 
        echo "OPENING: $file_path at line $line_number"
        kate "$file_path" -l "$line_number"
    else
        echo "No matches found."
    fi
}

# To call the function, you would use:
open_kate_at_line "timer () {" "/home/thomas/Development/linux-stuff/shell_functions.sh"
```

Make sure to source the script or add it to your `.bashrc` or `.bash_profile` to make the function available in your shell.

Explanation of changes:

1. Removed the incorrect use of `which` and the complex command substitution. It's not needed for the function call.
2. Added quotes around `$file_pattern` in the `grep` command to handle file paths with spaces.
3. Added quotes around `$file_path` and `$line_number` when calling `kate` to handle potential spaces or special characters.
4. Added an `else` statement to print "No matches found." if the `grep` command doesn't find the keyword.
5. Corrected the function call to directly pass the keyword and file pattern as arguments.

Make sure that the `kate` text editor is installed on your system and that the file path is correct. If `kate` is not installed or not in your `PATH`, the function will not work as expected.
