**Prompt:**
sqlite3 $HOME/logs.db ".schema"                                                                                                   ✔  11s  

**Response:**
It seems like you're trying to execute a command to display the schema of an SQLite database named `logs.db` located in your home directory. The `.schema` command in SQLite is used to show the SQL CREATE statements for all tables and indexes within the database.

To execute this command, you should open your terminal or command prompt and run the following command:

```bash
sqlite3 $HOME/logs.db ".schema"
```

This command will start the SQLite3 command-line interface, open the `logs.db` database file, and then execute the `.schema` command to output the schema of the database.

If you're having trouble with this command or if it's not working as expected, please ensure that:

1. SQLite3 is installed on your system.
2. The `logs.db` file exists in your home directory.
3. You have the necessary permissions to access and read the `logs.db` file.

If you're still facing issues, please provide more context or any error messages you're receiving, and I'll be happy to help you troubleshoot further.

**Prompt:**
CREATE TABLE [_llm_migrations] (

**Response:**
It looks like you've started to provide the SQL statement for creating a table named `_llm_migrations` in an SQLite database. However, the statement is incomplete. To create a table in SQLite, you need to specify the columns and their data types, along with any constraints you wish to enforce.

Here's an example of what a complete `CREATE TABLE` statement might look like for a migrations table:

```sql
CREATE TABLE _llm_migrations (
    id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY AUTOINCREMENT,
    migration_name TEXT NOT NULL,
    applied_at DATETIME NOT NULL
);
```

In this example, the `_llm_migrations` table has three columns:

- `id`: An integer that serves as the primary key and auto-increments with each new row.
- `migration_name`: A text field that stores the name of the migration.
- `applied_at`: A datetime field that records when the migration was applied.

The `NOT NULL` constraint ensures that the `migration_name` and `applied_at` columns cannot be empty.

If you want to create a table with different columns or constraints, you'll need to modify the SQL statement accordingly. If you provide the full list of columns and any specific requirements, I can help you construct the complete `CREATE TABLE` statement for your `_llm_migrations` table.
