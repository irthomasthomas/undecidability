**Prompt:**
use swagger-ui with a openapi.yaml in arch linux

**Response:**
Swagger UI allows you to visualize and interact with the API's resources without having any of the implementation logic in place. It's an open-source project that can be integrated with any application that serves an OpenAPI-compliant YAML or JSON document. Here are the steps to use Swagger UI with an `openapi.yaml` in Arch Linux:

### Step 1: Install Node.js and npm

If you don't have Node.js and npm installed, you can install them using Arch Linux's package manager, `pacman`.

```bash
sudo pacman -Syu nodejs npm
```

### Step 2: Install Swagger UI

You can install Swagger UI via npm:

```bash
npm install -g swagger-ui-dist
```

You can also clone the repository from GitHub if you prefer to work with the source code:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/swagger-api/swagger-ui.git
cd swagger-ui
npm install
npm run build
```

### Step 3: Serve Your OpenAPI Document

Serve the `openapi.yaml` using a web server or a package like `http-server`:

```bash
npm install -g http-server
http-server -p 8080
```

Notice that `http-server` serves files from the current directory, so make sure your `openapi.yaml` is in the directory where you run `http-server`.

### Step 4: Access Swagger UI

Depending on how you installed Swagger UI, there are different ways to access it:

**Option A: If you've installed via npm globally,**

Copy the `openapi.yaml` file to the `node_modules/swagger-ui-dist` directory. Swagger UI can serve it directly if you rename the `openapi.yaml` to `swagger.json` or serve it as YAML but adjust the URL accordingly:

```bash
cp /path/to/your/openapi.yaml /usr/lib/node_modules/swagger-ui-dist
cd /usr/lib/node_modules/swagger-ui-dist
http-server -p 8081
```

Then navigate to `http://localhost:8081` in your web browser, and append the query parameter `?url=openapi.yaml` to the URL (assuming you renamed the yaml to swagger.json).

**Option B: If you're working with the GitHub clone,**

Update the development server configuration to point to your `openapi.yaml`. To do this, open the `dev-helpers/index.html` file. Look for the `SwaggerUIBundle` configuration and update the `url` value to point to your `openapi.yaml` through an HTTP accessible URL:

```javascript
const ui = SwaggerUIBundle({
  url: "http://localhost:8080/openapi.yaml",
  // Other configurations...
}
```

After configuring, you can run the development server:

```bash
npm start
```

Then, visit `http://localhost:3200` in your browser to see your API documented with Swagger UI.

### Step 5: Interact with Your API

With Swagger UI running and serving your `openapi.yaml` file, you can now interact with your API through the Swagger UI browser interface. Make sure the API itself is running and accessible for Swagger UI to interact with it.

Be aware that if you have a CORS policy on your API server, you need to permit requests from the location where Swagger UI is hosted, or else you might encounter cross-origin request issues.
