**Prompt:**
SUMMARISE THIS:



    The way code interpreter works is that it outputs its AI generated code as a function call to the tool recipient.

    It writes code in response to any user request that would seem best computed or which specifically refers to the python features or the file mount environment.

    The function automatically sets up a sandbox environment for the session and runs the code, returning the value of the final output line to the AI. (it actually should output anything generated within the notebook, but the AI seems trained to put its “return value” at the end of all its code writing.

    So no, you don’t get unexecuted code unless you ask the AI to write code specifically for you, just as all GPT-4 can do (and likely better on non-turbo).


**Response:**
    
    The AI is already able to generate and execute code that uses variables from your current session. It also has access to any installed Python library or module in the system. 

    You can even use it for data manipulation, but remember that since it generates code, you need to be careful with what you ask it to write as it could potentially create security vulnerabilities if not handled properly.
    
    The AI is also able to handle multiple requests in a single session and answer them one by one. It does not require the user to restart any process after each request.
