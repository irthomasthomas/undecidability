**Prompt:**
CAREFULLY AND BRIEFLY SUMMARISE THIS:



    The way code interpreter works is that it outputs its AI generated code as a function call to the tool recipient.

    It writes code in response to any user request that would seem best computed or which specifically refers to the python features or the file mount environment.

    The function automatically sets up a sandbox environment for the session and runs the code, returning the value of the final output line to the AI. (it actually should output anything generated within the notebook, but the AI seems trained to put its “return value” at the end of all its code writing.

    So no, you don’t get unexecuted code unless you ask the AI to write code specifically for you, just as all GPT-4 can do (and likely better on non-turbo).


**Response:**

    The AI does not execute or modify any existing files in your file system. It only interacts with a specific project and environment set up by you within this server.

    All code that is generated by the AI are strings, which can be copied into an already existing file if needed to be modified.

    The tool doesn't have access to any external databases or APIs for information retrieval unless specifically instructed/configured to do so. It only interacts with files in your current project and its environment.

    You are the one responsible for managing all resources, including file system, docker images, gpu usage etc., related to this tool.

    The AI model used is pre-trained on a wide variety of knowledge and understanding about various languages and can be fine-tuned as per your specific needs in each session.
