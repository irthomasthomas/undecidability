**Prompt:**
Open a link from firefox in another app. Using Arch Linux and KDE Plasma.

**Response:**
To open a link from Firefox in another application on Arch Linux with KDE Plasma, you can use the following general steps:

1. **Copy the URL**: First, copy the URL from the address bar in Firefox by right-clicking on it and selecting "Copy."

2. **Open the Desired Application**: Open the application you want to use with the link. This could be a different web browser, a media player for streaming links, a download manager, or any other application that can handle URLs.

3. **Paste the URL**: In the application where you want to open the link, find the option to open a new URL. This might be a menu option like "File" > "Open URL," a keyboard shortcut, or a command-line argument if you're opening the application from the terminal. Paste the URL you copied from Firefox into the appropriate field or command.

For example, if you want to open a YouTube link in VLC media player, you would:

- Copy the URL from Firefox.
- Open VLC.
- Go to "Media" > "Open Network Stream" (or press Ctrl+N).
- Paste the URL into the field and click "Play."

If you want to automate this process or create a more integrated solution, you can use KDE's file associations to set up custom URL handling for specific types of links. Here's how to do that:

1. **Open System Settings**: Click on the application launcher and search for "System Settings," then open it.

2. **Go to File Associations**: In the System Settings, look for "Applications" and then "File Associations."

3. **Add a New File Type**: Click "Add..." to create a new file type. You can define a new MIME type for specific URL patterns or protocols.

4. **Set the Application Preference**: Once you've created a new file type, you can set the preferred application to handle this type of URL. You can move your desired application to the top of the application preference list.

5. **Apply Changes**: Click "Apply" to save your changes.

Now, when you click on a link in Firefox that matches the MIME type or protocol you've defined, KDE should prompt you to open the link with the application you've set as the default for that type.

Please note that not all applications can handle all types of URLs directly, and some links may require specific protocols that the application must support. If you encounter any issues, make sure the application you're trying to use is capable of handling the URL you're trying to open.
