**Prompt:**
Monitor multiple audio inputs on arch linux from the front mic and rear mic / input

**Response:**
To monitor multiple audio inputs on Arch Linux, such as the front and rear microphone inputs, you can use a combination of ALSA (Advanced Linux Sound Architecture) and PulseAudio tools. Here's a step-by-step guide to help you set this up:

1. **Install Necessary Packages**:
   Make sure you have `alsa-utils` and `pulseaudio` installed. You can install them using the package manager `pacman`:

   ```bash
   sudo pacman -S alsa-utils pulseaudio pulseaudio-alsa pavucontrol
   ```

2. **Check Your Audio Inputs**:
   Use `arecord -l` to list all the capture hardware devices available:

   ```bash
   arecord -l
   ```

   This will show you the card and device numbers for your audio inputs.

3. **Unmute and Adjust Levels**:
   Run `alsamixer` to unmute and adjust the levels of your audio inputs:

   ```bash
   alsamixer
   ```

   Use the F6 key to select your sound card, and then navigate to your microphone inputs. Make sure they are not muted (a muted channel will have `MM` at the bottom; you can unmute it by pressing the `M` key) and adjust the levels as needed using the arrow keys.

4. **Configure PulseAudio**:
   PulseAudio is a sound server that works on top of ALSA and provides a more user-friendly way to manage audio devices and streams.

   You can use `pavucontrol`, the PulseAudio Volume Control GUI, to manage your audio devices more easily. Run it from the terminal:

   ```bash
   pavucontrol
   ```

   In the `Input Devices` tab, you can see all your audio inputs. Make sure to unlock the channels (click the padlock icon if it's locked) so you can adjust each channel individually if needed.

5. **Monitor Audio Inputs**:
   To monitor the audio inputs, you can use the `pavucontrol` interface. In the `Input Devices` tab, click the button with a microphone icon (labeled as "Set as fallback" on hover) to select the default input device. Then, click the button under the "Port" section to choose between the front or rear microphone input.

   If you want to listen to the input directly (also known as software monitoring), you can click the button with a speaker icon (labeled as "Monitor of") in the `Output Devices` tab. This will route the audio from the input to your speakers or headphones.

6. **Advanced Configuration**:
   If you need more advanced routing and monitoring capabilities, you might want to look into using JACK Audio Connection Kit along with a tool like `qjackctl` or `cadence`. JACK provides a more complex but powerful way to route audio between applications and hardware devices.

   To install JACK and its control interface, you can use:

   ```bash
   sudo pacman -S jack2 qjackctl
   ```

   Keep in mind that using JACK may require additional configuration and might be overkill if you only need simple monitoring.

Remember that audio configuration can vary greatly depending on your specific hardware and software setup. If you encounter any issues, consult the Arch Wiki pages on [PulseAudio](https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/PulseAudio) and [ALSA](https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/Advanced_Linux_Sound_Architecture) for more detailed information and troubleshooting tips.
