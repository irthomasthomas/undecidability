**Prompt:**
Can I stream the mic and audio from my phone using scrcpy? I want to stream to YT with obs and I want to capture all audio from the phone.

**Response:**
As of my knowledge cutoff date in early 2023, scrcpy does not support streaming the microphone audio from the phone. It can only forward audio output (i.e., the sound that comes from the device's speakers or headphones). This means you can capture the audio from media playback, notifications, and other system sounds, but not the audio from the microphone.

To forward audio output, you can use the `--audio` option (or `--audio-source=output` to be explicit). Here's how you would start scrcpy with audio forwarding:

```sh
scrcpy --audio
```

Keep in mind that audio forwarding might not work on all devices, and it requires at least Android 10.

If you want to capture both the audio output and the microphone input from your phone for streaming to YouTube with OBS, you will need to use a different method for the microphone audio. Here are a couple of options:

1. **Use a separate microphone connected to your computer**: You can use a microphone connected directly to your computer to capture your voice. This is the simplest solution and will provide you with the best control over audio quality.

2. **Use an audio mixer app on your phone**: There are apps available that can mix the microphone input with the system audio output and stream it to your computer. You would then capture this mixed audio stream in OBS.

3. **Use a hardware audio mixer**: If you have an audio mixer, you can connect your phone's headphone output to the mixer and also connect a microphone to the mixer. Then, send the mixed audio from the mixer to your computer for capture in OBS.

Remember that when setting up audio for streaming, you'll want to monitor for any potential latency or sync issues between the video and audio streams and adjust accordingly in OBS.
