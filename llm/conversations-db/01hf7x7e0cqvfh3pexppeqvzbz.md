**Prompt:**
Why does audio from some apps play through the phone instead of pc?

**Response:**
When using scrcpy to mirror and control your Android device from a PC, you might encounter situations where audio from certain apps plays through the phone's speakers instead of the PC. This can happen due to a variety of reasons:

1. **App Restrictions**: Some apps have DRM (Digital Rights Management) restrictions or specific audio routing configurations that prevent their audio from being captured or redirected. For example, streaming services like Netflix or Hulu may have such restrictions to prevent unauthorized recording or streaming of their content.

2. **Audio Focus**: Android manages audio focus to decide which app gets to control the audio output. If an app requests audio focus and specifies that it will play audio through the device speakers, scrcpy might not be able to capture and forward that audio to the PC.

3. **Audio Output Selection**: scrcpy allows you to select the audio source using the `--audio-source` option. If this is not set correctly, it might not capture the audio you expect. The default is to capture the device's internal audio output, but if an app is using a different audio stream, it might not be captured.

4. **System Limitations**: Some versions of Android or specific device models might have limitations or bugs that affect audio capture and forwarding.

5. **scrcpy Version**: Ensure you are using a version of scrcpy that supports audio forwarding. Audio forwarding was introduced in scrcpy v1.10, and improvements have been made in subsequent versions. Always use the latest version of scrcpy for the best compatibility and feature support.

6. **Audio Codec Compatibility**: scrcpy uses certain audio codecs to encode and transmit audio. If there's an incompatibility with the codec used by the app and the codec supported by scrcpy, it might result in audio not being played through the PC.

7. **Technical Limitations**: Audio forwarding in scrcpy relies on capturing the audio output of the device. If an app bypasses the standard audio output mechanisms of Android, scrcpy might not be able to capture its audio.

To troubleshoot this issue, you can try the following:

- Update scrcpy to the latest version to ensure you have the latest audio forwarding capabilities.
- Check if the issue is app-specific. If it is, it's likely due to app restrictions or DRM.
- Experiment with different `--audio-source` options to see if you can capture the desired audio stream.
- Check if there are any settings within the app that allow you to change the audio output behavior.

If the audio from certain apps still plays through the phone instead of the PC despite these efforts, it may be due to restrictions or limitations that cannot be overcome with scrcpy.
