**Prompt:**
How can I increase the font size in kitty in arch?

**Response:**
To increase the font size in Kitty, a GPU-based terminal emulator, you can use a couple of methods:

1. **Using Keyboard Shortcuts:**
   Kitty allows you to increase or decrease the font size on the fly using keyboard shortcuts. By default, you can press `Ctrl` + `Shift` and `+` to increase the font size, or `Ctrl` + `Shift` and `-` to decrease it. If you want to reset the font size to the default, you can press `Ctrl` + `Shift` and `Backspace`.

2. **Modifying the Configuration File:**
   If you want to set a larger font size permanently, you can edit Kitty's configuration file. The default location for the configuration file is `~/.config/kitty/kitty.conf`. If the file doesn't exist, you can create it. Here's how you can change the font size:

   - Open the terminal and type the following command to edit the configuration file with your preferred text editor (e.g., nano, vim, etc.):
     ```bash
     nano ~/.config/kitty/kitty.conf
     ```
   - Add or modify the line that sets the font size. For example, to set the font size to 14, you would add:
     ```
     font_size 14.0
     ```
   - Save the file and exit the text editor. The changes will take effect the next time you start Kitty.

3. **Using the Command Line:**
   You can also change the font size for the current session by using the `kitty` command with the `--font-size` option. For example, to set the font size to 14, you can start Kitty with the following command:
   ```bash
   kitty --font-size 14
   ```

Remember that the keyboard shortcuts can be customized in the `kitty.conf` file, so if the default shortcuts don't work, you may want to check your configuration for any custom key mappings.

After making changes to the configuration file, you may need to restart Kitty for the changes to take effect. If you have any running instances of Kitty, you can simply close and reopen them to apply the new settings.
