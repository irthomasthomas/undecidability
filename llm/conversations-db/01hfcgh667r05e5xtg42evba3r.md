**Prompt:**
What software still uses python 3.8 and linux 4.4.0

**Response:**
As of my knowledge cutoff in early 2023, specific software that continues to use Python 3.8 and Linux kernel 4.4.0 would typically be found in environments where stability and long-term support are prioritized over having the latest features. This includes:

1. **Enterprise environments**: Companies that prioritize stability may continue to use Python 3.8 and Linux 4.4.0, especially if they have developed applications that depend on the specific features and behavior of those versions.

2. **Legacy systems**: Systems that were developed around the time when Python 3.8 and Linux 4.4.0 were current may still be in use, particularly if they perform their intended function satisfactorily and there is no compelling reason to update.

3. **Long-Term Support (LTS) distributions**: Some Linux distributions that offer long-term support may still provide Linux kernel 4.4.0 as an option. For example, Ubuntu 16.04 LTS, which was supported until April 2021, used a kernel based on 4.4.0. While the official support has ended, some organizations might use extended support options or continue to use it without support.

4. **Embedded systems**: Devices with long development cycles, such as certain embedded systems, may use older kernels like 4.4.0 due to the extensive validation and certification processes required.

5. **Cloud services**: Some cloud service providers may offer environments with Python 3.8 for compatibility reasons, allowing customers to run applications that require this specific version.

6. **Academic and research projects**: Projects that began development using Python 3.8 may continue to use it to maintain consistency and reproducibility of results.

It is difficult to provide a comprehensive list of specific software without current data, as usage patterns change over time and depend on the policies and practices of individual organizations and projects.
