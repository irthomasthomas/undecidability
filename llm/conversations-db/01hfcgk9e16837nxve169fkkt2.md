**Prompt:**
In early 2023 ChatGPT Code Interpreter used 

**Response:**
The term "ChatGPT Code Interpreter" is not a standard reference to a specific product or feature as of my last update. If you are referring to OpenAI's ChatGPT with coding capabilities, it was integrated with a version of OpenAI's Codex model, which is designed to interpret and generate code. This allows ChatGPT to understand programming languages and provide code-related responses. If you are referring to a different or new tool or feature introduced after my last update, I would not have information on it. Please clarify or provide more context if you are referring to a specific tool or feature introduced in early 2023.
