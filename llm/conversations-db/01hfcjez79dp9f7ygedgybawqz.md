Changes made for compatibility with Python 3.8 and Linux kernel 4.4.0:

1. `subprocess.run` now uses `shell=True` for commands that contain spaces, which are likely to be shell commands that require shell interpretation.
2. `text=True` is used instead of `universal_newlines=True` for `subprocess.run` to ensure compatibility with Python 3.7+.
3. The newline character is explicitly added as `"\n"` instead of `"

"` for clarity and consistency.
4. No changes were required for Linux kernel compatibility as the script interacts with user-level utilities and the filesystem, which are abstracted from the kernel version.

Can you simplify that

**Response:**
```python
import subprocess
import os

def list_available_commands():
    unique_commands = set()
    for directory in os.environ['PATH'].split(':'):
        try:
            unique_commands |= {item for item in os.listdir(directory) 
                                if not item.startswith('.') and os.access(os.path.join(directory, item), os.X_OK)}    
        except FileNotFoundError:
            pass
    return unique_commands

commands = [
    "neofetch",
    "inxi -Fxxxz",
    "lscpu",
    "lsmem",
    "lsblk",
    "uname -a",
    "\n".join(sorted(list_available_commands()))
]

with open('system_info.txt', 'w') as file:
    for cmd in commands:
        process = subprocess.run(cmd, shell=' ' in cmd, stdout=subprocess.PIPE, stderr=subprocess.DEVNULL, text=True)
        file.write(process.stdout + "\n")
```

Simplifications and explanations:
- Used set comprehension and set union operator `|=` to merge executable commands inside the `list_available_commands` function.
- Condensed the `subprocess.run` call and eliminated the check for whether `cmd` is a string because the `commands` list only contains strings.
- Used `shell=' ' in cmd` to provide shell execution for commands containing spaces, and direct execution otherwise.
