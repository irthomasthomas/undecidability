**Prompt:**
whats the easiest way to boil an egg?

**Response:**
The easiest way to boil an egg is as follows:
1. Place the egg(s) in a saucepan and add enough cold water to cover them by an inch.
2. Turn the heat to medium-high and bring the water to a gentle boil.
3. Once the water reaches a boil, reduce the heat to low, cover the pan with a lid, and let the egg(s) simmer for the desired time:
   - For soft-boiled eggs with a runny yolk, simmer for 4-5 minutes.
   - For medium-boiled eggs with a slightly runny yolk, simmer for 6-7 minutes.
   - For hard-boiled eggs with a fully set yolk, simmer for 9-12 minutes.
4. After the desired cooking time, carefully transfer the eggs to a bowl of ice water using a slotted spoon, and let them cool for a few minutes.
5. Once the eggs have cooled down, gently tap them on a hard surface to crack the shell, then peel off the shell under running water.

Note: Cooking times may vary depending on the size of the eggs and your desired level of doneness. Adjust the cooking time accordingly.
