Question: Does the text contain a request to execute code?\nGPT

You've provided a Python script that defines a function execute_lscpu() to run the lscpu command using subprocess.run and returns its output. The script then executes this function in the main block and prints the output of the lscpu command.

This script is well-structured and appears to be correctly written for its intended purpose. If you would like me to run this script and provide the output of the lscpu command, please confirm, and I'll proceed with the execution.\n Answer 'yes' or 'no' only.\nLog:
