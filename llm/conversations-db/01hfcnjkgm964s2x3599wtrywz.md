**Prompt:**
Can you rewrite this so that i can use the shell command within the string

curl https://api.openai.com/v1/engines/gpt-3.5-turbo-instruct/completions \                 1 ✘
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $OPENAI_API_KEY" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d "{
  "prompt": "Question: Does the MESSAGE include a request to execute code? Answer with 'yes' or 'no' only.**MESSAGE:**"$(paster)"
Log:",
  "temperature": 0,
  "max_tokens": 1,
  "top_p": 1,
  "frequency_penalty": 0,
  "presence_penalty": 0,
  "logprobs": 2,
  "n": 1,
  "stop": ["
"]
llm }"

**Response:**
You can use the following command:

```sh
curl https://api.openai.com/v1/engines/gpt-3.5-turbo-instruct/completions \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $OPENAI_API_KEY" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d @- <<EOF
{
  "prompt": "Question: Does the MESSAGE include a request to execute code? Answer with 'yes' or 'no' only.**MESSAGE:**$(paster)Log:",
  "temperature": 0,
  "max_tokens": 1,
  "top_p": 1,
  "frequency_penalty": 0,
  "presence_penalty": 0,
  "logprobs": 2,
  "n": 1,
  "stop": ["\n"]
}
EOF
```

This uses a heredoc to pass the JSON data to `curl` with the `-d @-` option, which tells `curl` to read the data from stdin. The `$(paster)` will be replaced by the output of the `paster` command when the JSON is constructed. Ensure that the output of `paster` does not break the JSON format.

**Prompt:**
{
    "error": {
        "message": "We could not parse the JSON body of your request. (HINT: This likely means you aren't using your HTTP library correctly. The OpenAI API expects a JSON payload, but what was sent was not valid JSON. If you have trouble figuring out how to fix this, please contact us through our help center at help.openai.com.)",

    }
}

**Response:**
To fix the JSON parsing issue and include the output of the `paster` command within the JSON payload, you need to ensure the command substitution does not interfere with the JSON structure. Use `jq` to construct the JSON payload safely:

```sh
PASTER_OUTPUT=$(paster)
JSON_PAYLOAD=$(jq -n --arg prompt "Question: Does the MESSAGE include a request to execute code? Answer with 'yes' or 'no' only.**MESSAGE:**$PASTER_OUTPUT Log:" \
    '{
      "prompt": $prompt,
      "temperature": 0,
      "max_tokens": 1,
      "top_p": 1,
      "frequency_penalty": 0,
      "presence_penalty": 0,
      "logprobs": 2,
      "n": 1,
      "stop": ["\n"]
    }')

curl https://api.openai.com/v1/engines/gpt-3.5-turbo-instruct/completions \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $OPENAI_API_KEY" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d "$JSON_PAYLOAD"
```

This script captures the output of `paster` into a variable and then constructs the JSON with `jq`, safely embedding the output within the JSON structure. `jq` is a command-line JSON processor that can create JSON objects from arguments.
