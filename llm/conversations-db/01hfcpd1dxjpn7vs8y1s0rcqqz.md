REQUEST: GPT

You've provided a Python script that defines a function execute_lscpu() to run the lscpu command using subprocess.run and returns its output. The script then executes this function in the main block and prints the output of the lscpu command.

This script is well-structured and appears to be correctly written for its intended purpose. If you would like me to run this script and provide the output of the lscpu command, please confirm, and I'll proceed with the execution.

**Response:**
The script is designed to send a payload to the OpenAI API with a prompt that includes the text of the request. The API is expected to return a completion based on the prompt. The script uses `jq` to construct a JSON payload that includes the prompt, various parameters to control the generation, and the logprobs. It then uses `curl` to send this payload to the OpenAI API.

The response from the API is empty because the `max_tokens` parameter is set to 1, and the prompt ends with a `stop` sequence (`"\n"`). The `max_tokens` parameter limits the output to a single token, and the `stop` sequence immediately stops the generation, resulting in no additional tokens being generated. The API correctly returns an empty text completion as instructed by the script's parameters.

**Prompt:**
I see. Can you fix it?

**Response:**
To ensure the script produces an answer from the OpenAI API, remove the `stop` sequence and adjust the `max_tokens` to an appropriate number for the expected length of the answer. Here's the modified script segment:

```sh
JSON_PAYLOAD=$(jq -n --arg prompt "Question: Does the MESSAGE include a request to execute code? Answer with 'yes' or 'no' only. MESSAGE:$REQUEST" \
    '{
      "prompt": $prompt,
      "temperature": 0,
      "max_tokens": 10, # Adjust the number of tokens as needed
      "top_p": 1,
      "frequency_penalty": 0,
      "presence_penalty": 0,
      "logprobs": 2,
      "n": 1
    }')
```

Make sure to replace `max_tokens` value with the number of tokens sufficient to get the desired response length. The `stop` field was removed, allowing the model to generate a response.

    "completion_tokens": 1,
    "total_tokens": 19
  }
}

**Response:**
The reason the bare `curl` command works and provides a 'yes'/'no' answer despite the `max_tokens` being set to 1 and the presence of a `stop` sequence is that the model requires only a single token to complete the prompt as per the instruction. The instruction specified in the prompt restricts the answer to 'yes' or 'no', which are each one token long, so the model is able to provide a complete answer within the constraints set by the `max_tokens` parameter.

The stop sequence represented as `"stop": ["\n"]` should ordinarily tell the model to stop generating further tokens after a newline character is reached. However, since the completion ('yes' or 'no') is reached before this point and comprises a single token aligning with the `max_tokens: 1` parameter, the condition for `stop` does not come into effect - the model already completed the generation after generating the required one token.

**Prompt:**
Can you rewrite it in python. Here is some info that may or may not be helpful: [https://community.openai.com/t/how-do-i-prompt-the-api-to-return-me-only-the-probability-from-0-a-100-of-something/132328/5](https://community.openai.com/t/how-do-i-prompt-the-api-to-return-me-only-the-probability-from-0-a-100-of-something/132328/5)

Some working details you need to know … you need to convert the token_logprobs to a linear scale before converting it to a percent.

Example: I have a categorizer from Babbage that is trained to output ’ 0’ or ’ 1’. In this example, say ’ 1’ means the lead is going to buy, and ’ 0’ means the lead won’t buy.
`
"choices": [{"text": " 1", "index": 0, "logprobs": {"tokens": [" 1"], "token_logprobs": [-3.170517e-06], "top_logprobs": [{" One": -13.691312, " 1": -3.170517e-06}], "text_offset": [356]}, "finish_reason": "length"}], "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 124, "completion_tokens": 1, "total_tokens": 125}}'`

Then define the base of the natural logarithm:

e = 2.718281828459

Then take the log probs out of the JSON response and convert to linear:

# get the log probability (base e)
```
LogProb = FullReaction["choices"][0]["logprobs"]["token_logprobs"][0]
print(f"LogProb: {LogProb}")
                    
```
# convert the log probability to a probability in [0,1]
Prob = e**LogProb
Then multiply the Prob value by 100 to get your percent from the chosen value. So if the value in linear from the chosen value is 0.99 for ' 0', you set the percent to 1-0.99 or 1%. If it is 0.99 for ’ 1’, you set it to 99%. Slight details, but that is all you need.

To get the log_probs info to show up in the response, I believe you just call it out, and since I am making a binary decision on 1-token, here is the core JSON settings to send over:

`{"temperature": 0, "max_tokens": 1, "top_p": 1, "logprobs": 2, "frequency_penalty": 0, "presence_penalty": 0}`

Not sure why request 2 of them, but I only use the single one from token_logprobs.

Details matter, but this is what you need to do to get it to work.

So in my example, I get
```

LogProb = -3.170517e-06 for token ' 1' = BUY!
Prob = e**LogProb
print(Prob)
# 0.999996829488026
```
SO the lead has a 99.9996829488026 percent chance of buying. WOOT!

**Response:**
Here is a Python script that constructs a request to the OpenAI API, sends it, and converts the log probability of the model's chosen token to a percentage likelihood.

```python
import requests
import math
import json

def get_probability(prompt, model="gpt-3.5-turbo-instruct"):
    e = math.e  # base of natural logarithm
    headers = {
        "Authorization": f"Bearer {openai_api_key}",
        "Content-Type": "application/json",
    }
    
    data = {
        "prompt": prompt,
        "temperature": 0,
        "max_tokens": 1,
        "top_p": 1,
        "logprobs": 2,
        "frequency_penalty": 0,
        "presence_penalty": 0
    }
    
    response = requests.post(
        f"https://api.openai.com/v1/engines/{model}/completions",
        headers=headers,
        data=json.dumps(data)
    )

    response_json = response.json()
    log_prob = response_json["choices"][0]["logprobs"]["token_logprobs"][0]
    probability = e ** log_prob
    
    if response_json["choices"][0]["text"].strip() == '1':
        # If '1' means the lead will buy, we use the calculated probability directly
        percent = probability * 100
    else:
        # If the response is '0', we use 1 - probability to get the chance of not buying
        percent = (1 - probability) * 100

    return percent

# Sample usage:
openai_api_key = "your-api-key"
sample_prompt = "Question: Is this lead going to buy? Answer with '0' or '1' only.\nLog:"
percent_chance = get_probability(sample_prompt)
print(f"{percent_chance:.2f}% chance of buying.")
```

In this script, replace `your-api-key` with your actual OpenAI API key.

1. The `get_probability` function constructs the API request with preset parameters as specified.
2. It sends the request to the OpenAI API, using the Python `requests` library.
3. Once getting the response, it extracts the `token_logprobs` for the chosen token.
4. It calculates the linear-scale probability from the logarithmic probability.
5. The probability is then converted to a percentage, and if the chosen token is '0' (meaning the lead won't buy), it subtracts the probability from 1 to get the chance of not buying, and vice versa.
6. The function returns this percentage, and it's printed in the sample usage.

**Prompt:**
I want to input a block of text and get a yes or no to whether it contains a request to execute code

**Response:**
Here's a Python script using OpenAI's API to check whether a block of text contains a code execution request and return 'yes' or 'no':

```python
import requests

def check_code_execution_request(text, openai_api_key):
    headers = {
        "Authorization": f"Bearer {openai_api_key}",
        "Content-Type": "application/json",
    }

    data = {
        "prompt": f"Question: Does the following message include a request to execute code? Answer with 'yes' or 'no' only.\nMESSAGE: {text}\n",
        "temperature": 0,
        "max_tokens": 1,
        "top_p": 1,
        "logprobs": None,
        "frequency_penalty": 0,
        "presence_penalty": 0,
        "stop": ["\n"]
    }

    response = requests.post(
        "https://api.openai.com/v1/engines/gpt-3.5-turbo/completions",
        headers=headers,
        json=data
    )

    result = response.json()
    return result["choices"][0]["text"].strip()

# Sample usage:
api_key = "your-api-key-here"
block_of_text = "Please execute the `ls` command and send me the output."
answer = check_code_execution_request(block_of_text, api_key)
print(f"Contains code execution request: {answer}")
```

Replace `your-api-key-here` with your real OpenAI API key. This script formulates a prompt asking if the given text contains a code execution request, sends this to the API with a `max_tokens` of 1 to receive a single word answer, and prints that answer.

This script accepts `block_of_text` as a command-line argument. It retrieves the `OPENAI_API_KEY` from the environment variable. Usage from terminal:

```sh
python script.py "Enter the text here"

**Prompt:**
all that returned is 'choices'

**Response:**
If the output is merely `'choices'`, this indicates the API may not be returning the expected 'yes' or 'no' results and is likely due to an error in the payload or API response handling. Ensure the prompt and parameters are correctly formatted and that the API key is valid. Here's a refined version of the script with additional print statements for debugging:

```python
import requests
import os
import sys

def check_code_execution_request(text, openai_api_key):
    headers = {
        "Authorization": f"Bearer {openai_api_key}",

    }

    data = {

    }

    response = requests.post(
        "https://api.openai.com/v1/engines/gpt-3.5-turbo/completions",
        headers=headers,
        json=data
    )

    response_json = response.json()
    return response_json["choices"][0]["text"].strip()

if __name__ == "__main__":
    try:
        openai_api_key = os.getenv("OPENAI_API_KEY")
        if not openai_api_key:
            raise ValueError("The OPENAI_API_KEY environment variable is not set.")
        
        if len(sys.argv) < 2:
            raise ValueError("You must provide a block of text as an argument.")
        
        block_of_text = sys.argv[1]
        answer = check_code_execution_request(block_of_text, openai_api_key)
        print(f"Contains code execution request: {answer}")
    except Exception as e:
        print(f"Error: {e}")
```

In the revised script:
- Removed the `stop` parameter since it's not necessary when looking for a short 'yes' or 'no' response.
- Added a check to ensure at least one argument is passed to the script.
- Added a more general exception handling at the end to catch and print any errors.

To run the script, save it as a `.py` file, for example, `check_request.py`, and then from the terminal:

```sh
python check_request.py "Your block of text here."
```

Ensure that the environment variable `OPENAI_API_KEY` is set correctly before running the script.

**Response:**
This message suggests a key error happened, likely because the response JSON from OpenAI's API did not contain the 'choices' key. This could happen if there was an error in the API response. Add error handling to check the API response status and print the response content for debugging:

```python

        headers=headers,
        json=data
    )

    if response.status_code == 200:
        response_json = response.json()
        try:
            return response_json["choices"][0]["text"].strip().lower()
        except KeyError:
            raise KeyError(f"Unexpected response format: {response_json}")
    else:
        raise Exception(f"API request failed with status code {response.status_code}: {response.text}")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    try:
        openai_api_key = os.getenv("OPENAI_API_KEY")
        if not openai_api_key:
            raise ValueError("The OPENAI_API_KEY environment variable is not set.")
        
        if len(sys.argv) < 2:
            raise ValueError("You must provide a block of text as an argument.")
        
        block_of_text = ' '.join(sys.argv[1:])  # Join all arguments to support text with spaces
        answer = check_code_execution_request(block_of_text, openai_api_key)

    except Exception as e:
        print(f"Error: {e}")
```

This script now checks the status code of the response and raises an exception if the request failed. It also catches and raises a `KeyError` if the expected 'choices' key is not in the JSON response. The status code and response text will be printed if an error occurs. The `' '.join(sys.argv[1:])` line allows the script to accept sentences with spaces as input.
