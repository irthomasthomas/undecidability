NAME
Terminator - Multiple GNOME terminals in one window

SYNOPSIS
terminator [options]

DESCRIPTION
This manual page documents Terminator, a terminal emulator application.

Terminator is a program that allows users to set up flexible arrangements of GNOME terminals. It is aimed at those who normally arrange lots of terminals
near each other, but don't want to use a frame based window manager.

OPTIONS
This program follow the usual GNU command line syntax, with long options starting with two dashes (â€˜-'). A summary of options is included below.

-h, --help
Show summary of options

-v, --version
Show the version of the Terminator installation

-m, --maximise
Start with a maximised window -M, --maximize Start with a maximized window

-f, --fullscreen
Start with a fullscreen window

-b, --borderless
Instruct the window manager not to render borders/decoration on the Terminator window (this works well with -m)

-H, --hidden
Hide the Terminator window by default. Its visibility can be toggled with the hide_window keyboard shortcut (Ctrl-Shift-Alt-a by default)

-T, --title
Force the Terminator window to use a specific name rather than updating it dynamically based on the wishes of the child shell.

--geometry=GEOMETRY
Specifies the preferred size and position of Terminator's window; see X(7).

-e, --command=COMMAND
Runs the specified command instead of your default shell or profile specified command. Note: if Terminator is launched as x-terminal-emulator -e beâ€�
haves like -x, and the longform becomes --execute2=COMMAND

-x, --execute COMMAND [ARGS]
Runs the rest of the command line instead of your default shell or profile specified command.

--working-directory=DIR
Set the terminal's working directory

-g, --config FILE
Use the specified FILE for configuration

-r, --role=ROLE
Set a custom WM_WINDOW_ROLE property on the window

-l, --layout=LAYOUT
Start Terminator with a specific layout. The argument here is the name of a saved layout.

-s, --select-layout=LAYOUT
Open the layout launcher window instead of the normal terminal.

-p, --profile=PROFILE
Use a different profile as the default

-i, --icon=FORCEDICON
Set a custom icon for the window (by file or name)

-u, --no-dbus
Disable DBus

-d, --debug
Enable debugging output (please use this when reporting bugs). This can be specified twice to enable a built-in python debugging server.

--debug-classes=DEBUG_CLASSES
If this is specified as a comma separated list, debugging output will only be printed from the specified classes.

--debug-methods=DEBUG_METHODS
If this is specified as a comma separated list, debugging output will only be printed from the specified functions. If this is specified in addition
to --debug-classes, only the intersection of the two lists will be displayed

--new-tab
If this is specified and Terminator is already running, DBus will be used to spawn a new tab in the first Terminator window.
