3. **Software Updates**: Broadcast `sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get upgrade` to update all servers or sessions at once without having to repeat the command for each.

4. **Development Workflow**: When working on a project spread across multiple services, broadcast `git pull` to update all repositories in grouped terminals.

5. **Educational Demonstrations**: In a teaching environment, broadcast commands to all terminals to demonstrate command-line usage to a class, ensuring all students are following along.

6. **Network Scanning**: Broadcast a `nmap` scan command to grouped terminals to scan different subnets or IP ranges simultaneously.

7. **Log Tail**: Broadcast `tail -f` on different log files in grouped terminals to watch real-time logs from multiple services or applications.

8. **Permission Changes**: Broadcast `chmod` or `chown` to update permissions on similar files or directories across multiple locations.

9. **Environment Syncing**: Broadcast `source` to load environment variables or virtual environments across terminals for consistent development environments.
