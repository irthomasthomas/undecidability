**Response:**
1. **System Monitoring**: Broadcast a `top` or `htop` command to all terminals to monitor system resources across different servers or sessions simultaneously.

2. **Batch Updates**: Send a package update command like `sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get upgrade` to grouped terminals to update multiple systems at once.

3. **File Operations**: Execute file operations such as copying or moving files in multiple directories by broadcasting `cp` or `mv` commands to grouped terminals.

4. **Service Management**: Start, stop, or restart services on multiple systems by broadcasting system control commands like `systemctl start service_name`.

5. **User Notifications**: Broadcast `echo` messages to send notifications or alerts to all terminals, useful in a collaborative environment.

6. **Development Tasks**: Run build scripts or version control commands like `git pull` across multiple project directories in grouped terminals.

7. **Educational Purposes**: In a teaching environment, demonstrate command-line operations to students by broadcasting commands to all terminals projected on a screen.

8. **Network Operations**: Perform network diagnostics like `ping` or `traceroute` on different network segments by broadcasting to terminals connected to various networks.

9. **Log Monitoring**: Tail logs from different applications or services by broadcasting `tail -f /path/to/logfile` to grouped terminals for simultaneous monitoring.
