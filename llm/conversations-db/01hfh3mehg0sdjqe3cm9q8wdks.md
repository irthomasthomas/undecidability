**Prompt:**
Do you know what hint-prompt-buffer-mode does in nyxt browser?

**Response:**
As of my last update in early 2023, Nyxt browser is a keyboard-oriented, extensible web browser designed for power users. It is inspired by Emacs and Vim, and it allows for extensive customization and control over the browsing experience.

The `hint-prompt-buffer-mode` in Nyxt is a mode that facilitates link navigation and interaction with web page elements without using a mouse. When you activate this mode, Nyxt displays hints (usually letters or numbers) next to clickable elements on the webpage, such as links, buttons, form fields, and other interactive items.

To use `hint-prompt-buffer-mode`, you would typically press a keyboard shortcut to enter the mode, and then type the hint associated with the element you want to interact with. This allows you to quickly navigate to links, activate buttons, or focus on form fields using only the keyboard.

The "prompt-buffer" part of the name suggests that when you activate this mode, Nyxt may display a prompt buffer (a separate pane or area in the interface) where you can see the hints and possibly filter or search through them, making it easier to find the specific element you want to interact with.

The exact details of how `hint-prompt-buffer-mode` works, including the default keybindings and behavior, may vary depending on the version of Nyxt and any custom configurations you have applied. For the most accurate and up-to-date information, you should refer to the Nyxt documentation or the in-browser help system.
