**Prompt:**
Add a cover image to the start of an mkv video?

**Response:**
To add a cover image to the start of an MKV video, you can use `mkvmerge` from the MKVToolNix suite. The command would be structured as follows:

```sh
mkvmerge --attach-file cover.jpg -o output.mkv input.mkv
```

This command attaches `cover.jpg` as an attachment to `input.mkv` and outputs the result to `output.mkv`. To set it as the cover, you may need to ensure that the MIME type is set correctly and that the attachment is named `cover.jpg` or `cover.png`, as some players use the filename to determine the cover image.

If you want the image to be a part of the video stream (i.e., to display as the first frame(s) of the video), you would need to create a short video clip from the image and then concatenate it with the main video. This can be done using `ffmpeg`:

```sh
ffmpeg -loop 1 -i cover.jpg -c:v libx264 -t 5 -pix_fmt yuv420p -vf scale=1920:1080 cover.mkv
ffmpeg -f concat -safe 0 -i <(printf "file '%s'\n" cover.mkv input.mkv) -c copy output.mkv
```

The first command creates a 5-second video clip from the image. The second command concatenates the cover clip with the main video. Adjust `-t` for the duration and `-vf scale=` for the resolution as needed.
