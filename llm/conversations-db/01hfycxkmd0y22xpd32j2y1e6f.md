**Response:**
To record from multiple microphones simultaneously on Arch Linux using PipeWire, you can use a command-line tool like `pw-record` or `parec` (from PulseAudio, which is compatible with PipeWire). However, you'll need to create a virtual source that combines both microphones into one. Here's how you can do it:

1. Identify the sources you want to record from. You've already listed your sources with `wpctl status`. You need the names of the front and rear microphones. If they are not listed, you may need to plug them in and ensure they are recognized by the system.

2. Create a combined virtual source using `pw-cli`. This step might require some scripting, as PipeWire does not have a built-in command to create a combined source like PulseAudio's `module-combine-sink`. You would need to create a custom PipeWire graph that routes both microphones to a virtual device.

3. Once you have your virtual source, you can record from it using `pw-record`. The command would look something like this:

```bash
pw-record --target=<virtual-source-name> output.wav
```

Replace `<virtual-source-name>` with the name of your virtual source.

Since creating a virtual source in PipeWire can be complex and is not as straightforward as in PulseAudio, you might consider using PulseAudio's module for this task if you're more comfortable with it. Here's how you could do it with PulseAudio:

1. Load the `module-combine-sink` module to create a virtual source that combines both microphones:

```bash
pactl load-module module-combine-sink sink_name=combined sources=<source1-name>,<source2-name>
```

Replace `<source1-name>` and `<source2-name>` with the names of your front and rear microphones.

2. Record from the virtual source using `parec`:

```bash
parec --device=combined.monitor | sox -t raw -r 44100 -s -L -b 16 -c 2 - "output.wav"
```

This command pipes the output from the virtual source to `sox` to save it as a WAV file.

Please note that the exact commands and module names may vary based on your system configuration and the versions of the software you are using. If you encounter any issues, you may need to consult the PipeWire or PulseAudio documentation for more detailed instructions or seek help from the Arch Linux community forums or other support channels.
