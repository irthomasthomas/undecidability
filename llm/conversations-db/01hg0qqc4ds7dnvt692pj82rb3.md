**Prompt:**


**Response:**
The term "cognitive computing" refers to systems that learn at scale, reason with purpose, and interact with humans naturally. These systems are designed to mimic the human brain by processing information, learning from it, and making decisions based on that learning. Cognitive computing systems can understand, reason, and learn, which makes them capable of solving complex problems. They can also interact with humans in a more natural and intuitive way, making them more user-friendly.
