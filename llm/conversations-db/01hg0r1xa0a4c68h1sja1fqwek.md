**Prompt:**


**Response:**
The term "dual citizenship" refers to a legal status in which a person is a citizen of two countries at the same time. This can occur through various means such as birth, marriage, or naturalization. Each country has its own citizenship laws and policies, and not all countries allow dual citizenship. For those that do, dual citizens are generally considered to be fully citizens of both countries, with all the rights and responsibilities that come with citizenship.
