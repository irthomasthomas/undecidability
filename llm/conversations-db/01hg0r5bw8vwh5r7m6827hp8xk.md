**Response:**
The term "cognitive computing" refers to systems that learn at scale, reason with purpose, and interact with humans naturally. These systems are designed to mimic the human brain's functioning by learning and interpreting patterns, processing natural language, and making decisions. Cognitive computing systems can process vast amounts of complex information, making them valuable in fields like healthcare, finance, and customer service. They can also adapt and learn from their interactions and experiences, much like humans do.
