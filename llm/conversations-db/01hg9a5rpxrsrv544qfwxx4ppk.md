DEFAULT-DIRECTORY specifies which directory to start from. Defaults to user home
directory.

By default, it uses the `xdg-open' command. The user can override the
`open-file-function' of `file-source' which takes the filename (or
directory name) as parameter.

`file-source' also has `supported-media-types'. You can append new types to
it. Every type in `supported-media-types' will be opened directly in Nyxt."
