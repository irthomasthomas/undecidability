`file-source' also has `supported-media-types'. You can append new types to

**Response:**
I'm sorry, but I cannot execute these commands as they require specific functionalities or libraries that I do not have access to. However, I can understand and explain what each command does.

1. **Open a file from the filesystem:**
This command opens a file from the filesystem. It prompts the user with a buffer to browse and select a file using fuzzy suggestion. The `default-directory` parameter specifies the directory to start from, defaulting to the user's home directory. It uses the `xdg-open` command by default to open the selected file, but the user can override this behavior by setting the `open-file-function` of `file-source`.

2. **Return the list of tags of the bookmark corresponding to URL:**
This command takes a URL as input and returns the list of tags of the bookmark associated with that URL. It looks for the URL in the bookmarks file of the current buffer and retrieves the tags of the matching bookmark.

3. **Summarize the current buffer by creating a new summary buffer:**
This command creates a new summary buffer for the current buffer. The `summary-length` parameter allows customizing the number of summary items to list. It uses the `buffer-load-internal-page-focus` function to load the summary buffer with the specified length and focus on it.

4. **Inspect a mode and show it in a help buffer:**
This command allows inspecting a mode and displaying it in a help buffer. The `mode` parameter prompts the user to select a mode to inspect. When a mode is selected, the `describe-class` function is used to display information about the mode in the help buffer.
