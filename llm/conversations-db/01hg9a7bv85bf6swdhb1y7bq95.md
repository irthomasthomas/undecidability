DEFAULT-DIRECTORY specifies which directory to start from. Defaults to user home

By default, it uses the `xdg-open' command. The user can override the
`open-file-function' of `file-source' which takes the filename (or
directory name) as parameter.

`file-source' also has `supported-media-types'. You can append new types to
it. Every type in `supported-media-types' will be opened directly in Nyxt."

**Response:**
AI: I have defined three commands for you. 

1. "open-file": This command allows you to open a file from the filesystem. It prompts you with a buffer where you can browse files using fuzzy suggestions. The default directory is set to the user's home directory, but you can specify a different directory if needed. By default, it uses the `xdg-open' command to open the file, but you can override this behavior by setting the `open-file-function' of `file-source'. You can also specify supported media types in `file-source' to open them directly in Nyxt.

2. "url-bookmark-tags": This function returns the list of tags of the bookmark corresponding to a given URL. It retrieves the bookmarks from the bookmarks file of the current buffer and finds the bookmark with a matching URL. If a matching bookmark is found, it returns the tags associated with it.

3. "summarize-buffer": This command creates a new summary buffer by summarizing the current buffer. You can specify the length of the summary by setting the `summary-length' parameter. The default value is 5. The summary buffer is loaded with the `buffer-load-internal-page-focus' function, which takes care of creating the buffer and focusing on it. The summary buffer is identified by the buffer ID.

4. "describe-mode": This command allows you to inspect a mode and show its details in a help buffer. It prompts you to enter the mode you want to describe and then uses the `describe-class' function to show the details of the mode in a help buffer.

Please let me know if you need any further assistance.
