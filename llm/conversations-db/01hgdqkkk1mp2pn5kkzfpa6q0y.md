**Prompt:**
Why does nyxt browser have both Keywords and Tags when adding bookmarks?

**Response:**
Nyxt browser's design philosophy emphasizes user customization and extensibility. The inclusion of both Keywords and Tags for bookmarks serves different purposes and use cases:

1. Keywords: They are typically used for quick access or search shortcuts. A keyword can be associated with a URL or a search query, allowing for faster navigation or searching without having to type the full URL or search term.

2. Tags: Tags offer a more flexible and granular way to categorize and organize bookmarks. They support a many-to-many relationship, where a single bookmark can have multiple tags, and a single tag can be associated with multiple bookmarks. This facilitates more complex retrieval and sorting of bookmarks based on various criteria.

The dual system allows users to choose the most appropriate method for their workflow, or to use both in conjunction for more powerful and personalized bookmark management.

Language Agent Tree Search Unifies Reasoning Acting and Planning in Language Models
6 Oct 2023  ·  Andy Zhou, Kai Yan, Michal Shlapentokh-Rothman, Haohan Wang, Yu-Xiong Wang ·  Edit social preview
While large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated impressive performance on a range of decision-making tasks, they rely on simple acting processes and fall short of broad deployment as autonomous agents. We introduce LATS (Language Agent Tree Search), a general framework that synergizes the capabilities of LLMs in planning, acting, and reasoning. Drawing inspiration from Monte Carlo tree search in model-based reinforcement learning, LATS employs LLMs as agents, value functions, and optimizers, repurposing their latent strengths for enhanced decision-making. What is crucial in this method is the use of an environment for external feedback, which offers a more deliberate and adaptive problem-solving mechanism that moves beyond the limitations of existing techniques. Our experimental evaluation across diverse domains, such as programming, HotPotQA, and WebShop, illustrates the applicability of LATS for both reasoning and acting. In particular, LATS achieves 94.4\% for programming on HumanEval with GPT-4 and an average score of 75.9 for web browsing on WebShop with GPT-3.5, demonstrating the effectiveness and generality of our method.

**Response:**
Keywords:
- LATS
- Language Models
- Tree Search
- Reinforcement Learning
- Decision-Making

Tags:
- AI Research
- Language Models
- Tree Search Algorithms
- Reinforcement Learning
- Autonomous Agents
- Planning and Acting
- GPT-4
- GPT-3.5
- Decision-Making Systems
- Monte Carlo Methods

These keywords and tags categorize the bookmark by the primary framework (LATS), the domain (AI/Language Models), methodologies (Tree Search/Reinforcement Learning), and specific models discussed (GPT-4 and GPT-3.5). They enable both quick access and nuanced classification, useful for retrieval in diverse research inquiries.

**Prompt:**
It looks like nyxt tags and keywords need be one word. Is that true?

**Response:**
That constraint is not typical for tagging systems or keyword implementations, which often permit multi-word phrases enclosed in quotation marks or similar delimiters. However, if Nyxt's system does indeed require single words, here's how the keywords and tags could be adjusted:

Keywords:
- LATS
- LanguageModels
- TreeSearch
- ReinforcementLearning
- DecisionMaking

Tags:
- AIResearch
- LanguageModels
- TreeSearchAlgorithms
- ReinforcementLearning
- AutonomousAgents
- PlanningAndActing
- GPT4
- GPT3_5
- DecisionSystems
- MonteCarlo

Adapted to single words or concatenated phrases to fit the constraint, while still aiming to maintain the essence of the categorization.
