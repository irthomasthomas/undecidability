**Prompt:**
Script to merge all sqlite3 .db files in a path

**Response:**
To merge all SQLite `.db` files in a path, you can use a script that iterates over each database file, attaches it to a main database, and then copies the data into a unified schema. Here's a basic example in Bash that assumes all databases have the same schema:

```bash
#!/bin/bash

# Path where the .db files are located
db_path="/path/to/databases"
# Output database file
output_db="merged.db"

# Create or clear the output database
sqlite3 "$output_db" ".read clear_output_db.sql"

# Iterate over all .db files in the specified path
for db_file in "$db_path"/*.db; do
    # Skip the output database if it's in the same path
    if [ "$db_file" == "$output_db" ]; then
        continue
    fi

    # Attach the current database to the output database
    sqlite3 "$output_db" "ATTACH DATABASE '$db_file' AS to_merge;"

    # Assuming a table named 'data_table'. Adjust the query for your schema.
    # Copy data from the attached database to the output database
    sqlite3 "$output_db" "BEGIN TRANSACTION; INSERT INTO main.data_table SELECT * FROM to_merge.data_table; COMMIT;"

    # Detach the current database
    sqlite3 "$output_db" "DETACH DATABASE to_merge;"
done

echo "Merging complete."
```

Before running this script, you need to create a `clear_output_db.sql` file that contains the SQL commands to create the schema for the `merged.db`. This file will be read by the script to initialize the output database with the correct schema.

Make sure to adjust the script to match your actual table names and schema. If the schemas differ between databases, you will need to modify the script to handle the differences, such as by using `INSERT INTO ... SELECT` with explicit column names or by applying transformations to the data.

Remember to give the script execution permissions with `chmod +x script_name.sh`.
