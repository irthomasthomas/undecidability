**Prompt:**
search pip for tkinter

**Response:**
To search for packages related to `tkinter` on PyPI (Python Package Index), you can use the following command in your terminal or command prompt:

```bash
pip search tkinter
```

However, as of late 2020, the `pip search` functionality has been disabled due to the overwhelming load on PyPI's servers. If you still want to search for `tkinter` related packages, you can use the PyPI website search functionality at https://pypi.org/search/?q=tkinter. 

`tkinter` itself is part of the standard library for Python, so it does not need to be installed via `pip`. It is included with Python when you install it, so you can simply import it in your scripts with `import tkinter`.
