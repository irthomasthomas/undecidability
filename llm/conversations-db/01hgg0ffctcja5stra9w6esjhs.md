ImportError: libtk8.6.so: cannot open shared object file: No such file or directory

**Response:**
The error message suggests that there is a missing shared object file called "libtk8.6.so" which is needed for the tkinter module to work properly. This file is typically part of the Tkinter library.

To resolve this issue, you can try the following steps:

1. Make sure you have Tkinter installed on your system. You can check this by running the command `python -m tkinter` in your terminal. If Tkinter is not installed, you can install it using your package manager or by running `pip install tkinter`.

2. If Tkinter is already installed, it's possible that the shared object file is missing or not in the expected location. You can try reinstalling Tkinter to see if it fixes the issue. Run `pip uninstall tkinter` to uninstall Tkinter, and then run `pip install tkinter` to reinstall it.

3. If reinstalling Tkinter doesn't work, you may need to install the missing shared object file manually. You can search for the file "libtk8.6.so" online and download it from a reputable source. Once downloaded, place the file in the appropriate directory (e.g., /usr/lib) or update the LD_LIBRARY_PATH environment variable to include the directory where the file is located.

4. If none of the above steps work, it's possible that there is a problem with your Python installation or system configuration. You may need to seek further assistance or consult the documentation for your specific operating system or Python distribution.

Please note that these suggestions are based on common troubleshooting steps and may not resolve the issue in all cases.

WARNING: Skipping tkinter as it is not installed.

**Response:**
The warning message suggests that tkinter is not installed in your Python environment. Since tkinter is not installed, you can proceed to the next step without uninstalling it.

You can try reinstalling tkinter by running the following command:

```shell
.venv/bin/python -m pip install tkinter
```

This will install the tkinter module in your Python environment. If the installation is successful, you can then try running your `video-clipper.py` script again to see if the error has been resolved.

ERROR: Could not find a version that satisfies the requirement tkinter (from versions: none)
ERROR: No matching distribution found for tkinter

**Response:**
The error message suggests that there is no specific version of the tkinter module available for installation via pip in your Python environment. This could be due to the way you have set up your environment or because tkinter is typically included as part of the standard Python distribution.

Since tkinter is generally included with Python by default, you may not need to install it separately. However, it seems that tkinter is missing from your Python installation or is not configured correctly.

Here are a few steps you can try to resolve the issue:

1. Check that you are using a valid version of Python: Make sure you are using a compatible version of Python that includes tkinter. You can check the Python version using the command `python --version`. If you are using an older or non-standard version of Python, consider upgrading to a more recent version.

2. Verify your Python installation: Verify that your Python installation is complete and properly configured. If tkinter is missing or not set up correctly, you may need to reinstall or reconfigure your Python environment.

3. Reinstall Python: If tkinter is still missing after verifying your Python installation, you can try reinstalling Python. Completely remove the existing Python installation from your system and then download and install the latest version from the official Python website.

4. Consult your operating system or Python distribution documentation: If the above steps do not resolve the issue, consult the documentation specific to your operating system or Python distribution for further guidance on installing or troubleshooting tkinter.

Please note that without more specific information about your system configuration, it can be challenging to provide a precise solution.
