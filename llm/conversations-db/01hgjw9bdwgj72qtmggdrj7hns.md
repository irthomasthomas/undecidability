**Prompt:**
What are the newer alternatives to BeautifulSoup in 2023?

**Response:**
As of my last update, newer alternatives to BeautifulSoup for parsing HTML in Python include:

1. `lxml`: While not newer, it's often recommended for better performance and has a similar API to BeautifulSoup.
2. `pyquery`: Provides a jQuery-like syntax for parsing HTML.
3. `parsel`: Used in Scrapy, it offers both XPath and CSS selectors.
4. `selectolax`: A newer library that's faster than BeautifulSoup, using Modest and Lexbor engines for parsing.

If there are newer libraries beyond these, I would not have information on them. Check PyPI or GitHub for the latest developments in HTML parsing libraries.
