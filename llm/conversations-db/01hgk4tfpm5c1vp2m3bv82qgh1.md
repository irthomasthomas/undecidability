**TASK**
**zsh: argument list too long: ttok


**Response:**
The error message "zsh: argument list too long" typically occurs when trying to execute a command with a large number of arguments that exceeds the system's limit. To resolve this issue, you can use the `xargs` command to split the arguments into smaller batches. Here's an example command:

```bash
echo ttok | xargs -n 1000 command
```

Replace `command` with the actual command you want to execute. The `-n 1000` option specifies that `xargs` should split the arguments into batches of 1000. Adjust this number as needed to fit within the system's limit.
