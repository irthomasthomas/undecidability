Error:Error reading JSON file: Expecting value: line 1 column 1 (char 0)

**Response:**
The error message you're getting, `Expecting value: line 1 column 1 (char 0)`, suggests that the JSON decoder was unable to find the JSON object that it was expecting. Additionally, your provided content does not appear to be a single JSON object but rather it looks like separate lines of JSON entries.

I'm assuming the file `kagi.txt` contains the provided content. Since it is line-delimited JSON, you would need to read it line by line rather than as a whole JSON object. Here's how you can modify your Python parser code to handle this:

```python
import json

file_path = '/home/thomas/Documents/kagi.txt'

# Create a list to hold parsed information.
parsed_content = []

# Check if the file is not empty.
if os.path.getsize(file_path) > 0:
    # Read the content from the file line by line.
    with open(file_path, 'r') as file:
        for line in file:
            # Skip empty lines and lines that are not JSON (like "id: CLOSE").
            line = line.strip()
            if line.startswith("id:") or not line:
                continue
            
            # The JSON objects are in the 'data' part of each line. Extract it.
            try:
                prefix, json_str = line.split('data: ', 1)
                data = json.loads(json_str)
                for item in data:
                    # Do your JSON parsing here.
                    # Note: Since this is an example, adjust the parsing as required.
                    parsed_item = {
                        'tag': item.get('tag'),
                        'content_text': None,
                        'sent_at': item.get('sent_at')
                    }

                    # Example parsing (update according to your needs)
                    payload = item.get('payload')
                    if payload and isinstance(payload, dict) and 'content' in payload:
                        # Assuming 'content' is a string for this example.
                        parsed_item['content_text'] = payload['content']

                    parsed_content.append(parsed_item)
                    
            except json.JSONDecodeError as e:
                print(f"Error parsing JSON on line: {e}")
            except ValueError as e:
                print(f"Error splitting line into prefix and JSON: {e}")
else:
    print("The file is empty.")

# Print or use the parsed content.
for content in parsed_content:
    print(content)
```

This code goes through the file line by line, extracts the `data` part following the `data:` prefix, and attempts to parse it as JSON. The logic inside the loop depends on the structure of your actual JSON data and needs to be adjusted based on what you want to extract from each JSON entry.
