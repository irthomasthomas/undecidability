**Prompt:**
Update this bash function. -Accept arbitrary paramaters -Add those paramaters after $1

$(paster)

**Response:**
It seems you're asking to update a bash function named `paster` to accept an arbitrary number of parameters and append these parameters after the first one. If `$1` is a specific command or filename, and the rest of the parameters should be appended, you can revise the function like this:

```bash
paster() {
    local command=$1
    shift
    "$command" "$@"   # This will execute the command with the rest of the arguments
}
```

What this function does is:

- `local command=$1` stores the first argument passed to the function in a local variable `command`.
- `shift` is a shell builtin used to remove the first argument from the list of positional parameters, so `$2` becomes `$1`, `$3` becomes `$2`, and so on.
- `"$command" "$@"` then executes the command stored in `command` with the rest of the provided arguments (`$@` expands to all the positional parameters, starting from `$1` after the `shift` operation).

This way, you can call your `paster` function with an arbitrary number of parameters like this:

```bash
paster some_command arg1 arg2 arg3 ...
```

And `some_command` will be executed with `arg1 arg2 arg3 ...` as its arguments. Please modify the function according to your exact requirements if needed. If `paster` is supposed to handle the parameters in a specific way that wasn't made clear in the original question, please provide additional information for more accurate assistance.
