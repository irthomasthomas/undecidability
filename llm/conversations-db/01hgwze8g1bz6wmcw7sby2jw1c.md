2023 CMake Error at /usr/share/cmake/Modules/CMakeTestCCompiler.cmake:67 (message):
  The C compiler

    "/usr/bin/cc"

  is not able to compile a simple test program.

  It fails with the following output:

    Change Dir: "
"


**Response:**
The error you are encountering indicates that CMake is attempting to test whether the C compiler (`/usr/bin/cc`) on your system is capable of compiling a simple test program, and this test has failed. This error can occur for a variety of reasons:

1. **No C Compiler Installed**: Ensure you have a C compiler installed. On a Debian-based system, you can install the default C compiler with:
   ```bash
   sudo apt-get update
   sudo apt-get install build-essential
   ```

2. **Incorrect C Compiler Path**: Check if `/usr/bin/cc` is actually pointing to a valid C compiler. Sometimes, `/usr/bin/cc` is a symlink to the actual compiler (`gcc` or `clang`). Verify that the symlink points to a valid compiler or specify the compiler manually by setting `CC` environment variable or by passing `-D CMAKE_C_COMPILER=<path-to-compiler>` to the CMake command.

3. **Permissions**: Ensure that you have the necessary permissions to execute the compiler and that the compiler is not blocked by any system policy.

4. **Compiler Configuration**: If you have multiple versions of compilers or have recently changed your development environment, there might be some misconfiguration in your environment settings. Check your `PATH` environment variable and other related configuration.

5. **Broken Compiler Installation**: Your C compiler may be incorrectly installed or corrupted. Reinstalling the compiler package might solve the issue.

6. **Missing Dependencies or Libraries**: The test program might require certain libraries or dependencies that are not installed on your system.

7. **Temporary Files**: Sometimes, left-over temporary files from previous CMake runs can cause problems. Clearing the CMake cache or making a clean build directory might help.

8. **Resource Constraints**: Check if there are any hardware or resource limitations at play, like low disk space or insufficient memory.

9. **Error Log Contents**: The output message mentioned does not include details about why the compilation failed. Usually, CMake would output an error log with specifics. Check `CMakeFiles/CMakeError.log` and `CMakeFiles/CMakeOutput.log` files in your build directory for detailed error messages that can help you pinpoint the cause.

10. **Visual Studio and Windows**: If this error is encountered on Windows, especially when the Visual Studio compiler is expected to be used, issues may arise if the Visual Studio environment has not been properly set up. Make sure that you are using the "Developer Command Prompt for VS" or have the appropriate environment variables set.

If after checking these points you're still encountering issues, please provide more context or details from the log files, which may contain information pertinent to the error you're experiencing.

    make: *** [Makefile:127: cmTC_a4f50/fast] Error 2

**Response:**
The error output indicates that the problem occurred during the linking stage of compiling the test C program. Specifically, the linker (`ld`) could not be found by `collect2`, which is a part of the GNU Compiler Collection (GCC) that handles linking. Here is the specific error message:

```
collect2: fatal error: cannot find ‘ld’
```

This suggests that there is an issue with your build environment where the linker is either not installed or not found in the expected location. Here's what you can do to resolve this issue:

1. **Check Linker Installation:** Make sure you have the GNU Binutils package installed, which includes the `ld` linker. On a Debian-based system, you can install Binutils with:
    ```bash
    sudo apt-get install binutils
    ```

2. **PATH Environment Variable:** Verify that the directory containing `ld` is in your `PATH` environment variable. You can check the location of `ld` with the `which` command:
    ```bash
    which ld
    ```

    If `ld` is not found, you need to locate the Binutils installation and ensure that its `bin` directory is added to your `PATH`. For example:
    ```bash
    export PATH=/path/to/binutils/bin:$PATH
    ```

3. **Check for Alternative Linkers:** The output shows that it's trying to use `mold` as the linker (`-fuse-ld=mold`). `mold` is an alternative to `ld`, a modern linker. If you meant to use `mold`, ensure it is installed and properly configured in your system. If you did not intend to use `mold`, you might have to adjust your build configuration to use the default `ld`.

4. **Corrupted Toolchain:** If the issue persists, you may have a corrupted installation of your toolchain. Reinstalling `gcc`, `g++`, and `binutils` might be necessary.

5. **Cross-Compilation or Custom Build Environments:** If you're cross-compiling or using a custom build environment, make sure that the linker is correctly set up for the target environment.

6. **Permissions and Access:** Ensure that your user has permissions to access the linker and that the execute permissions are correctly set for the linker binary.

After addressing the potential issues above, try running the build process again. If you're still having issues, ensure to clear any CMake cache and temporary build files before attempting to compile again.
