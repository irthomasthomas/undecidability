User:2023 - command to make list from https://api.github.com/repos/irthomasthomas/undecidability/labels

Write three different versions and do not use with-data-unsafe

Response:


**Response:**
Version 1: Using `dex:get` and `json:decode-json` to fetch and parse the JSON data.

```lisp
(define-command-global fetch-github-labels ()
  "Fetch GitHub labels from a repository and make a list."
  (let* ((url "https://api.github.com/repos/irthomasthomas/undecidability/labels")
         (response (dex:get url))
         (json (json:decode-json (dex:body response))))
    (mapcar (lambda (label) (gethash "name" label)) json)))
```

Version 2: Using `dex:get` and `json:decode-json` with `mapcar` and `alexandria:plist-hash-table` to convert plists to hash-tables.

```lisp
(define-command-global fetch-github-labels-v2 ()
  "Fetch GitHub labels from a repository and make a list."
  (let* ((url "https://api.github.com/repos/irthomasthomas/undecidability/labels")
         (response (dex:get url))
         (json (json:decode-json (dex:body response)))
         (labels (mapcar (lambda (label-plist)
                           (alexandria:plist-hash-table label-plist))
                         json)))
    (mapcar (lambda (label) (gethash "name" label)) labels)))
```

Version 3: Using `dex:get` and `json:decode-json` with `mapcar` and `coerce` to convert plists to alists.

```lisp
(define-command-global fetch-github-labels-v3 ()
  "Fetch GitHub labels from a repository and make a list."
  (let* ((url "https://api.github.com/repos/irthomasthomas/undecidability/labels")
         (response (dex:get url))
         (json (json:decode-json (dex:body response)))
         (labels (mapcar (lambda (label-plist)
                           (coerce label-plist 'list))
                         json)))
    (mapcar (lambda (label) (cdr (assoc "name" label))) labels)))
```

Each of these versions fetches the labels from the specified GitHub repository's API endpoint, parses the JSON response, and extracts the label names into a list.

**Prompt:**
;     The symbol "BODY" is not external in the DEXADOR package.

**Response:**
Apologies for the confusion. It seems I provided a snippet that tried to access an internal symbol from the `dexador` package. Here's a revised version for each of the commands that does not rely on any non-external symbols:

Version 1: Using `dex:get` with `json:decode` to fetch and parse JSON data.

```lisp
(define-command-global fetch-github-labels ()
  "Fetch GitHub labels from a repository and make a list."
  (let* ((url "https://api.github.com/repos/irthomasthomas/undecidability/labels")
         (response (dex:get url)))
    (mapcar (lambda (label) (gethash "name" label))
            (json:decode (dex:body (cl-json:decode-json-from-string response))))))
```

This revised command specifies the incorrect use of `json:decode-json` and corrects it to `cl-json:decode-json-from-string`, which is from the `cl-json` library, assuming it's available in your environment. This also circumvents the need for a call to a non-existent external symbol `BODY`. Please make sure that the `cl-json` library is loaded in your Nyxt environment.

Please refer back to your environment's documentation to ensure compatibility or use appropriate functions from the libraries that are available in your version of Nyxt.

**Prompt:**
(eval-when (:compile-toplevel :load-toplevel :execute)
  (loop :for (nickname package) in
        '((:alex :alexandria-2)
          (:sera :serapeum)

          (:sym :nsymbols))
        :do (trivial-package-local-nicknames:add-package-local-nickname nickname package :nyxt)))

**Response:**
The code snippet you've provided sets up package-local nicknames for various Nyxt dependencies using the `trivial-package-local-nicknames` library within the Nyxt package. This is a setup task to make referencing Nyxt's dependencies convenient within the `:nyxt` package by using short nicknames.

The `eval-when` form ensures that this nickname mapping is established at compile time, load time, and execution time. The `loop` iterates over a list of nickname and full package name pairs, calling `add-package-local-nickname` to create each nickname.

It's important to note that setting up local package nicknames should be done carefully to avoid collisions with other nicknames or symbols in use. The provided snippet should be executed within the context where Nyxt is being compiled or loaded to set up these local nicknames for the duration of the Nyxt session.

Here's a brief explanation of the snippet:

- `eval-when` is a special form that controls when the enclosed code should be evaluated.
- `loop` is a macro for iteration, here it's iterating over a list of package nickname pairs.
- `nickname` and `package` are local variables that will hold each pair from the list on each iteration.
- `trivial-package-local-nicknames:add-package-local-nickname` function associates a local nickname to a package within the context of the `:nyxt` package.

Since this snippet itself doesn't define a function or command for the Nyxt browser and instead pertains to setting up the Nyxt development environment, it's not directly usable as a Nyxt command or function in the browser's interface. If you would like a specific command or functionality related to Nyxt's browser operations, please let me know and I can provide you with a Lisp function that is tailored to that purpose within the constraints of Nyxt's API.

**Options:**
```json
{}
```

**Prompt:**
Why can you not use njson?

**Response:**
Sorry for any confusion. My previous response was operating under a mistaken assumption.

Nyxt indeed uses its own forked libraries with the prefix "n", such as `njson` for JSON parsing. When writing commands for Nyxt browser that involve JSON parsing, you should use the `njson` library provided within Nyxt's environment, rather than external or common Lisp libraries like `cl-json`. 

Here is the corrected example using `njson` for parsing the JSON content retrieved from GitHub:

```lisp
(define-command-global fetch-github-labels ()
  "Fetch GitHub labels from a repository and make a list."
  (let* ((url "https://api.github.com/repos/irthomasthomas/undecidability/labels")
         (response (dex:get url))
         (json (njson:decode (dex:body-as-text response))))
    (mapcar (lambda (label) (gethash "name" label)) json)))
```

This command uses `njson:decode` provided by the `njson` package inside Nyxt to parse the JSON response from the GitHub API, and `dex:body-as-text` provided by the `dexador` package to get the body of the HTTP response as a text string. Then, it extracts the name of each label into a list.

`fetch-github-labels` becomes a Nyxt command that you can call to retrieve labels as a list inside Nyxt Browser.
