**Prompt:**

The function NYXT-USER::RESPONSE is undefined.

**Response:**
It seems the piece of code you provided is written for Nyxt browser, which is a keyboard-oriented, extensible web-browser designed for power users. The code defines a new global command `show-github-repo-labels` that attempts to fetch and display labels for a GitHub repository using the GitHub API.

However, there is a mistake in your code snippet. The code is referencing `dex:get`, which is presumably a function for making a HTTP GET request, and then it's trying to use `with-result` and `with-data`, but these seem to be placeholders or pseudocode, and the `NYXT-USER::RESPONSE` function mentioned in your error message does not exist.

We will need to correct the function by removing, replacing, or defining the missing functions (`dex:get`, `with-result`, `with-data`, etc.). Since I don't have the specific implementation of `dex:get` and other possibly Nyxt-specific macros or functions, I'll give you a generalized outline of an HTTP request in Common Lisp, which you can adapt:

```lisp
(ql:quickload "drakma")

(defpackage :github-api
  (:use :cl :drakma))
(in-package :github-api)

(define-command-global show-github-repo-labels ()
  "Show the raw result from the GitHub API for the labels of the 'irthomasthomas/undecidability' repository."
  (let* ((url "https://api.github.com/repos/irthomasthomas/undecidability/labels")
         (response (http-request url)))
    (let ((buffer (make-buffer :title "*github-repo-labels*")))
      (with-current-buffer buffer
        (setf (buffer-data buffer) response)
        (display-buffer buffer)))))
```

Make sure you have `drakma` installed via Quicklisp (`(ql:quickload "drakma")`). Note that the code now uses `http-request` from Drakma to make a GET request. Also, the `make-buffer`, `with-current-buffer`, `buffer-data`, and `display-buffer` functions are hypothetical and would need to be replaced with actual Nyxt browser buffer manipulation functions or redefined to fit your code.

Since I'm not aware of the context of where these functions are defined, you would need to replace them with appropriate Nyxt browser API calls to handle the HTTP response and buffer display. Please consult the Nyxt documentation for the correct way to interact with buffers and to display content.
