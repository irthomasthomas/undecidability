Create a list of labels from this and save them to a slot in nyxt

**Response:**
To create a list of labels from the file content and save them to a slot in Nyxt, you can modify the code as follows:

```lisp
(defun save-github-labels ()
  "Save the labels of the repository https://api.github.com/repos/irthomasthomas/undecidability/labels."
  (let* ((url "https://api.github.com/repos/irthomasthomas/undecidability/labels")
         (response (dex:get url))
         (labels (cl-json:decode-json-from-string response)))
    (setf (slot-value *nyxt-instance* 'github-labels) labels)
    (format t "Labels saved to slot.")))
```

In this modified code, we first decode the JSON response using the `cl-json:decode-json-from-string` function to obtain a list of labels. We then use the `setf` function to save the labels to a slot named `github-labels` in the `*nyxt-instance*` object. Finally, we use `format` to print a message indicating that the labels have been saved.

Note that you need to make sure that the Nyxt instance is accessible in the scope of this function and that the slot `github-labels` is defined in the instance class.
