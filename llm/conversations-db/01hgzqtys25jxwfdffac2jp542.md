**Prompt:**
(defun save-github-labels ()
  "Save the labels of the repository https://api.github.com/repos/irthomasthomas/undecidability/labels."
  (let* ((url "https://api.github.com/repos/irthomasthomas/undecidability/labels")
         (response (dex:get url)))
    (with-open-file (file "labels.txt" :direction :output)
      (format file "~a" response))))

This return a file content like:
[{"id":5935764687,"node_id":"LA_kwDOKNgf3c8AAAABYcyUzw","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/irthomasthomas/undecidability/labels/Agents","name":"Agents","color":"fef2c0","default":false,"description":"Autonomous AI agents using LLMs"},{"id":5976028723,"node_id":"LA_kwDOKNgf3c8AAAABZDL2Mw","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/irthomasthomas/undecidability/labels/Algorithms","name":"Algorithms","color":"bfd4f2","default":false,"description":"Sorting, Learning or Classifying.

Create a list of labels from this and save them to a slot in nyxt

**Response:**
To create a list of labels from the file content and save them to a slot in Nyxt, you can modify the `save-github-labels` function as follows:

```lisp
(defun save-github-labels ()
  "Save the labels of the repository https://api.github.com/repos/irthomasthomas/undecidability/labels."
  (let* ((url "https://api.github.com/repos/irthomasthomas/undecidability/labels")
         (response (dex:get url))
         (labels (cl-json:decode-json-from-string response)))
    (setf (slot-value *nyxt* 'github-labels) labels) ; Save the labels to a slot in Nyxt
    (with-open-file (file "labels.txt" :direction :output)
      (format file "~a" response))))
```

This updated function uses the `cl-json:decode-json-from-string` function from the `cl-json` library to parse the JSON response into a Lisp data structure. Then, it sets the value of a slot named `github-labels` in the global variable `*nyxt*` to the parsed labels. Finally, it writes the response to the "labels.txt" file as before.

Make sure you have the `cl-json` library installed in your Nyxt environment, otherwise you will need to install it first.
