**Prompt:**
(defun save-github-labels ()
  "Save the labels of the repository https://api.github.com/repos/irthomasthomas/undecidability/labels."
  (let* ((url "https://api.github.com/repos/irthomasthomas/undecidability/labels")
         (response (dex:get url)))
    (with-open-file (file "labels.txt" :direction :output)
      (format file "~a" response))))

This produces a file like:
[{"id":5935764687,"node_id":"LA_kwDOKNgf3c8AAAABYcyUzw","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/irthomasthomas/undecidability/labels/Agents","name":"Agents","color":"fef2c0","default":false,"description":"Autonomous AI agents using LLMs"},{"id":5976028723,"node_id":"LA_kwDOKNgf3c8AAAABZDL2Mw","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/irthomasthomas/undecidability/labels/Algorithms","name":"Algorithms","color":"bfd4f2","default":false,"description":"Sorting, Learning or Classifying. All algorithms go here."}]

Save these labels to a slot for use in other nyxt functions.

**Response:**
To save the labels to a slot for use in other Nyxt functions, you can modify your code as follows:

```lisp
(defvar *github-labels* nil
  "Variable to store the GitHub labels.")

(defun save-github-labels ()
  "Save the labels of the repository https://api.github.com/repos/irthomasthomas/undecidability/labels."
  (let* ((url "https://api.github.com/repos/irthomasthomas/undecidability/labels")
         (response (dex:get url))
         (labels (jsown:parse-string response)))
    (setq *github-labels* labels)))

;; Example usage:
(save-github-labels)
(princ *github-labels*)
```

Now, the labels will be stored in the `*github-labels*` variable. You can access the labels in other functions by referring to this variable.

Note: Make sure to load the necessary dependencies (`dex`, `jsown`) before running the code.
