Error on separate thread: Symbol &quot;MAPC-RESPONSE&quot; not found in the NJSON package.


**Response:**
It seems like you're trying to use a function `njson:mapc-response` which does not exist in the `njson` package. The error message indicates that the symbol `MAPC-RESPONSE` is not found in the `NJSON` package. You might have intended to use a different function to iterate over the JSON response.

If you are using Common Lisp and you want to parse JSON, you might want to use a library like `cl-json` or `jsown`. Here's an example of how you could modify your function using `cl-json` to parse the JSON response and extract the desired information:

First, ensure you have the `cl-json` library installed. You can typically install it using Quicklisp:

```lisp
(ql:quickload "cl-json")
```

Then, you can use the `cl-json:decode-json-from-string` function to parse the JSON response:

```lisp
(defun save-github-labels ()
  "Save the labels of the repository https://api.github.com/repos/irthomasthomas/undecidability/labels."
  (let ((labels-list '()))
    (let* ((url "https://api.github.com/repos/irthomasthomas/undecidability/labels")
           (response (dex:get url))
           (json (cl-json:decode-json-from-string response)))
      (dolist (label json)
        ;; Extract the id, name, and description from each label and add them to the list
        (push (list (gethash "id" label)
                    (gethash "name" label)
                    (gethash "description" label))
              labels-list)))
    ;; Return the list of labels
    (nreverse labels-list)))
```

Please note that you'll need to replace `dex:get` with the appropriate function to perform an HTTP GET request and retrieve the response as a string. If you're using Drakma, for example, it would be `drakma:http-request`.

Also, ensure that you handle the GitHub API rate limits and authentication if necessary. GitHub's API typically requires an access token for higher rate limits and for accessing private repositories. You can pass this token in the headers of your HTTP request.

Make sure you have the `cl-json` library loaded in your environment before running the function. If you're using another JSON library, you'll need to adjust the parsing function accordingly.

assistant:


**Response:**
To save the GitHub labels to a list and make them available to other Nyxt functions, you can modify the `save-github-labels` function as follows:

```lisp
(defvar *github-labels-list* nil
  "List of GitHub labels with their id, name, and description.")

(defun save-github-labels ()
  "Save the labels of the repository https://api.github.com/repos/irthomasthomas/undecidability/labels."
  (let* ((url "https://api.github.com/repos/irthomasthomas/undecidability/labels")
         (response (dex:get url))
         (json (njson:decode response)))
    (setf *github-labels-list*
          (mapcar (lambda (label)
                    (list :id (getf label :id)
                          :name (getf label :name)
                          :description (getf label :description)))
                  json))
    *github-labels-list*))

;; Example usage:
(save-github-labels)  ; Fetch labels and save them to *github-labels-list*
```

In this code:

- `*github-labels-list*` is a global variable that will store the list of labels.
- The `save-github-labels` function fetches the labels from the GitHub API, decodes the JSON response, and then maps over each label to extract the `id`, `name`, and `description`, saving the result to `*github-labels-list*`.
- The `njson:decode` function is used to parse the JSON response into a Lisp data structure.
- The `mapcar` function is used to transform each label JSON object into a list with the desired properties.
- The `setf` function is used to update the value of `*github-labels-list*`.

Please note that you need to have the `njson` library loaded in your environment to use `njson:decode`. If you don't have it, you can install it using Quicklisp:

```lisp
(ql:quickload "njson")
```

Also, ensure that `dex:get` is the correct function to perform an HTTP GET request in your environment. If you're using a different HTTP client library, you'll need to adjust the code accordingly.

    #&lt;HASH-TABLE :TEST EQUAL :COUNT 7 {1019C84C33}&gt;)

is not of type
  LIST

**Response:**
It appears that the JSON response was decoded into hash tables rather than lists. In Lisp, a JSON object is often represented as a hash table, and you'll need to extract data from it accordingly.

You can modify the `save-github-labels` function to handle hash tables by using the `gethash` function instead of `getf`:

```lisp
(defvar *github-labels-list* nil
  "List of GitHub labels with their id, name, and description.")

(defun save-github-labels ()
  "Save the labels of the repository https://api.github.com/repos/irthomasthomas/undecidability/labels."
  (let* ((url "https://api.github.com/repos/irthomasthomas/undecidability/labels")
         (response (dex:get url))
         (json-elements (njson:decode response))) ; Assume njson:decode returns a list of hash-tables
    (setf *github-labels-list*
          (mapcar (lambda (label-hash)
                    (list :id (gethash "id" label-hash)
                          :name (gethash "name" label-hash)
                          :description (gethash "description" label-hash)))
                  json-elements))
    *github-labels-list*))

;; Example usage:
(save-github-labels)  ; Fetch labels and save them to *github-labels-list*
```

In this modified function:

- `gethash` is used to retrieve values from each hash table corresponding to the labels' `id`, `name`, and `description`.
- The `mapcar` function still applies a transformation over each element of the `json-elements` list, but now each element is expected to be a hash table.
- The result is a list of label information stored in `*github-labels-list*`.

Please ensure that your environment supports the `gethash` function for hash-tables and also make sure that `njson:decode` is used correctly according to the library used for JSON parsing.

This function will correctly populate the `*github-labels-list*` with details from the GitHub labels in a structured list format.

**Prompt:**
    #&lt;HASH-TABLE :TEST EQUAL :COUNT 7 {100A64E493}&gt;)

is not of type
  LIST

**Response:**
The error message you're seeing suggests that at some point, your code is expecting a list but it's receiving a hash table instead. If the `njson:decode` function returns a list of hash-tables or simply a hash table depending on the JSON structure, you'll need to handle the data properly when iterating over it.

Use `loop` instead of `mapcar` if `njson:decode` returns a list of hash tables, and `maphash` if it's a single hash table containing multiple key-value pairs.

Here's an adjusted version assuming `njson:decode` returns a list of hash tables:

```lisp
(defvar *github-labels-list* nil
  "List of GitHub labels with their id, name, and description.")

(defun save-github-labels ()
  "Save the labels of the repository https://api.github.com/repos/irthomasthomas/undecidability/labels."
  (let* ((url "https://api.github.com/repos/irthomasthomas/undecidability/labels")
         (response (dex:get url))
         (json-elements (njson:decode response))) ; Assume njson:decode returns a list of hash-tables.
    (setf *github-labels-list*
          (loop for label-hash in json-elements collect
                (list :id (gethash "id" label-hash)
                      :name (gethash "name" label-hash)
                      :description (gethash "description" label-hash))))
    *github-labels-list*))

;; Example usage:
(save-github-labels)  ; Fetch labels and save them to *github-labels-list*
```

If `njson:decode` returns a hash-table with all label entries contained within, you might need a different approach, such as iterating over the hash table using `maphash`.

```lisp
(defvar *github-labels* nil
  "List of GitHub labels with their id, name, and description.")

(defun save-github-labels ()
  "Fetch and save GitHub labels from the repository."
  (let ((url "https://api.github.com/repos/irthomasthomas/undecidability/labels"))
    (setf *github-labels*
          (let ((response (dex:get url))
                (labels '()))
            (maphash (lambda (k v)
                       (declare (ignore k)) ; Ignored if we're not using the key.
                       (push (list :id (gethash "id" v)
                                   :name (gethash "name" v)
                                   :description (gethash "description" v))
                             labels))
                     (njson:decode response))
            (nreverse labels)))))

;; Usage
(save-github-labels)  ; Will fetch and save the labels to the global variable *github-labels*
```

Please make sure you are using the correct iteration function depending on the type of the data structure returned by `njson:decode`. If needed, review the JSON decoding library's documentation to ensure proper usage.
