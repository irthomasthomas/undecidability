**Prompt:**
Can I zoom in on a youtube video on ipad?

**Response:**
Yes, you can zoom in on a YouTube video on an iPad using the pinch-to-zoom gesture. Here's how to do it:

1. Open the YouTube app on your iPad.
2. Start playing the video that you want to zoom in on.
3. Use two fingers to pinch out on the screen, just as you would with a photo or webpage. This will zoom into the video, filling the screen more.
4. To zoom back out, pinch your fingers together.
5. You can also drag the video around to focus on a specific part of the frame while you're zoomed in.

Keep in mind that zooming in on a video can result in a loss of quality since you're enlarging the video beyond its original resolution. Additionally, this feature may not be available on every video or might be limited by YouTube app updates, so make sure your app is up to date for the best experience.
