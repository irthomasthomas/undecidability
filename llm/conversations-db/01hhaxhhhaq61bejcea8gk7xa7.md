**Prompt:**
in arch install conda

**Response:**
To install Anaconda (which includes the Conda package manager) on Arch Linux, you won't be using the standard repositories as Anaconda isn't provided there. Instead, you'll need to download the Anaconda installer script from the official page and install it manually:

1. Visit the Anaconda Distribution page (https://www.anaconda.com/products/individual) to find and download the latest version of the Anaconda installer for Linux.

2. Open a terminal on your Arch Linux system.

3. Use `wget` or `curl` to download the installation script. Replace the URL with the correct one for the latest installer from the Anaconda website:
```bash
wget https://repo.anaconda.com/archive/Anaconda3-2022.05-Linux-x86_64.sh
```
or
```bash
curl -O https://repo.anaconda.com/archive/Anaconda3-2022.05-Linux-x86_64.sh
```

4. Make the downloaded script executable:
```bash
chmod +x Anaconda3-2022.05-Linux-x86_64.sh
```

5. Run the installation script:
```bash
./Anaconda3-2022.05-Linux-x86_64.sh
```

6. Follow the instructions on the screen. It's usually as simple as pressing ENTER to continue and typing 'yes' to accept the license terms. When prompted, choose whether to initialize Anaconda3 by running `conda init`.

7. Once the installation script has completed, restart your terminal or source your `.bashrc` or `.bash_profile` to make the changes take effect:
```bash
source ~/.bashrc
```
or (for *bash* shell)
```bash
source ~/.bash_profile
```
if you're using *zsh* or another shell, make sure to source the appropriate initialization file.

8. Verify the installation of Conda by running:
```bash
conda --version
```

Remember that Conda might install by default for only the user who installed it. If you want system-wide access, make sure you install it in a location accessible by all users and update the system-wide shell profile files.

Also, keep in mind that while Anaconda is a convenient package that includes Conda and many data science packages, if you only need the package manager without the added packages, Miniconda is a lighter alternative that you can install similarly.

Please replace the version in the download link with the latest one available from Anaconda when following these steps.
