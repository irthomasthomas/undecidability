**Response:**
The provided code snippet is a script that takes a PyTorch model checkpoint, splits certain parameters into shards, and saves each shard as a separate file. The script is designed to work with a model that has been trained with model parallelism, where certain weights are distributed across multiple devices.

The memory issue might be due to the fact that the entire original model checkpoint is loaded into memory at once, and then each shard is created by cloning the necessary parts of the model. This can be memory-intensive, especially if the model is large.

To reduce memory usage, you can modify the script to process and save each shard one at a time, and use `del` to free up memory after each shard is saved. Here's a modified version of the script that should use less memory:

```python
import torch
from pathlib import Path

Path("./converted").mkdir(exist_ok=True)

# Load only the state_dict keys to determine the tensor shapes without loading the actual tensors
state_dict_keys = torch.load("consolidated.00.pth", map_location="cpu", pickle_load=False).keys()
ori_keys = ["llma." + key for key in state_dict_keys]

shard_split_to = 8
weight_parallel_dim = {key: 1 if "weight" in key and "attention.wo" in key else 0 for key in ori_keys}

def func(rank=0):
    # Load the original checkpoint
    ori = torch.load("consolidated.00.pth", map_location="cpu")
    ori = {"llma." + key: val for key, val in ori.items()}

    split_ckpt = {}
    for key, ori_param in ori.items():
        if key in weight_parallel_dim:
            split_ckpt[key] = torch.chunk(ori_param, shard_split_to, weight_parallel_dim[key])[rank % shard_split_to].clone()
            if rank == 0:
                print(f"chunk {key}")
        else:
            if "experts." in key and int(key.split("experts.")[1].split(".")[0]) != rank:
                continue
            else:
                split_ckpt[key] = ori_param
                if rank == 0:
                    print(f"inherit {key}")
    # Save the shard
    torch.save({"model": split_ckpt}, f"converted/consolidated.{rank:02d}-of-08.model.pth")
    # Free up memory
    del split_ckpt
    torch.cuda.empty_cache()

for r in range(shard_split_to):
    func(r)
```

Here are the changes made to the original script:

1. The `weight_parallel_dim` dictionary is now dynamically generated based on the keys of the state dictionary. This assumes that only the weights of the `attention.wo` layers are split across devices, as indicated by the `1` values in the original dictionary.

2. The `func` function now loads the original checkpoint inside the function, processes it, and then deletes the processed shard from memory using `del` before moving on to the next shard.

3. The `torch.cuda.empty_cache()` call is used to clear any unused memory that might be cached by PyTorch's CUDA memory allocator. This is only necessary if you're running on a GPU; if you're using a CPU, this line can be omitted.

4. The `shard_split_to` variable is used directly in the loop instead of the hardcoded value `8`.

By processing one shard at a time and freeing up memory after each shard is saved, the script should use significantly less memory. However, keep in mind that this approach might be slower because it involves loading the original checkpoint multiple times. If the model is too large to fit into memory even when processing one shard at a time, you may need to consider other strategies, such as using a machine with more memory or further optimizing the checkpoint loading process.
