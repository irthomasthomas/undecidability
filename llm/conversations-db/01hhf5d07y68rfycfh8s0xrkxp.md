**Prompt:**
without rebooting or logging out?A

**Response:**
To change the default shell to zsh without rebooting or logging out, you need to update the user's shell setting in the user's configuration file. Here is the bash command to achieve that:

```bash
echo "exec zsh" >> ~/.bashrc && source ~/.bashrc
```

This will append the line "exec zsh" to the end of the user's `~/.bashrc` file, and then source the file to apply the changes immediately without the need to logout or reboot.
