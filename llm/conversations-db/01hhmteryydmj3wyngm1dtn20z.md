**Prompt:**
torch.cuda.OutOfMemoryError: CUDA out of memory. Tried to allocate 40.00 MiB. GPU 1 has a total capacty of 7.92 GiB of which 102.44 MiB is free. Including non-PyTorch memory, this process has 7.05 GiB memory in use. Of the allocated memory 6.91 GiB is allocated by PyTorch, and 13.00 MiB is reserved by PyTorch but unallocated. If reserved but unallocated memory is large try setting max_split_size_mb to avoid fragmentation.  See documentation for Memory Management and PYTORCH_CUDA_ALLOC_CONF

**Response:**
The error indicates that a PyTorch operation failed because it attempted to allocate 40 MiB of memory on GPU 1, but only 102.44 MiB was free out of a total capacity of 7.92 GiB. The process is using 7.05 GiB of memory, with 6.91 GiB allocated by PyTorch and 13.00 MiB reserved but unallocated.

To resolve this:

1. Reduce memory usage:
   - Decrease batch size.
   - Use checkpointing to trade compute for memory.
   - Optimize model architecture for memory efficiency.
   - Use mixed precision training (e.g., `torch.cuda.amp`).

2. Free up memory:
   - Ensure no other processes are using the GPU.
   - Manually clear memory with `torch.cuda.empty_cache()`.

3. Adjust memory fragmentation settings:
   - Set `max_split_size_mb` in `PYTORCH_CUDA_ALLOC_CONF` to a suitable value to reduce fragmentation.

4. Check for memory leaks:
   - Ensure tensors and graphs are being properly freed.

5. Use a more memory-efficient implementation if available.

If the issue persists, consider profiling the memory usage to identify the exact cause.

**Prompt:**
How to do 3?

**Response:**
To adjust the memory fragmentation settings by setting `max_split_size_mb`, use the environment variable `PYTORCH_CUDA_ALLOC_CONF`. This variable can be set before running your Python script to configure PyTorch's CUDA memory allocator behavior.

Example to set the `max_split_size_mb` to 128 MiB:

```bash
export PYTORCH_CUDA_ALLOC_CONF=max_split_size_mb:128
```

Set this in your shell before launching the Python process, or within Python using `os.environ` before importing PyTorch:

```python
import os
os.environ['PYTORCH_CUDA_ALLOC_CONF'] = 'max_split_size_mb:128'
import torch
```

The `max_split_size_mb` parameter controls the maximum size of a block that can be split into smaller blocks. It may help reduce fragmentation by limiting the granularity of splits. Experiment with the value to find an optimal setting for your specific workload.

**Prompt:**
I have one 8GB GPU and one 12GB

**Response:**
To manage memory across GPUs with different capacities, such as an 8GB and a 12GB GPU, you have a few options:

1. Set the `CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES` environment variable to specify which GPUs to use.
2. Use `torch.cuda.set_device(device_id)` to set the default GPU within your script.
3. Manually place different parts of your model or data on different GPUs within your code using `.to('cuda:device_id')`.

For memory management across GPUs with `PYTORCH_CUDA_ALLOC_CONF`, the setting will apply to all GPUs used by PyTorch. There is no built-in way to specify `max_split_size_mb` differently for each GPU.

If you hit OOM on the smaller GPU, consider using the larger GPU for more memory-intensive layers or operations. You could also use model parallelism and split the model across both GPUs, but this is complex and often not efficient due to cross-GPU communication overhead.

To explicitly specify GPU allocation for different parts of your model or data:

```python
# Assuming GPU 0 is 8GB and GPU 1 is 12GB
smaller_model_part.to('cuda:0')   # Place smaller parts on the 8GB GPU
larger_model_part.to('cuda:1')    # Place larger parts on the 12GB GPU
```

Remember to balance the compute load to avoid one GPU becoming a bottleneck. You can also set `PYTORCH_CUDA_ALLOC_CONF` based on the smaller GPU to avoid fragmentation on the GPU with lower capacity:

```bash
export PYTORCH_CUDA_ALLOC_CONF=max_split_size_mb:128
```

**Response:**
The provided code outlines a test scenario for generating text using two different models—one using FP32 (floating-point 32-bit) precision, and the other using FP16 (floating-point 16-bit) precision—to assess performance and potentially memory usage. The code sequentially loads the tokenizer and model for each precision, sets up the generation parameters, and invokes the text generation.

The `generate` function prints out the tokens per second rate for the tokenization process and text generation separately.

The `run_fp32_model` and `run_fp16_model` functions load models from specified file paths, with `run_fp16_model` calling `.half()` on the model to convert it to FP16 precision.

The loop at the bottom repeatedly clears the CUDA cache, invokes one of the model functions to load the tokenizer and model, and then calls the `generate` function to perform text generation, printing the result afterwards.

Key details:

- The generation is run on a CUDA device (GPU).
- The `generate` function assumes 1 character per token, which might be incorrect for certain tokenizers.
- `torch.set_default_dtype(torch.float16)` is set globally, which might affect other numerical operations beyond model loading/generation.
- `tokenizer` and `model` are assumed to be compatible with the loaded models' paths.
- The `generate` function is not optimally efficient since it decodes the output twice.
- `AutoModelForCausalLM.from_pretrained` is called with `device_map="sequential"` rather than specifically assigning models to each GPU.
- Text generation is done with a fixed prompt "Standing before the gates of".

If needed, adjust the token count for a more accurate measure of the tokenizer's performance, manage GPU memory more effectively, or improve token generation efficiency by avoiding redundant operations. Consider monitoring GPU utilization and memory usage if running into OOM issues.
