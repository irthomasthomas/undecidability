**Prompt:**
split 4 saftensors files into 8

**Response:**
To split 4 Stable Diffusion (SAF) tensors into 8, you would typically need to divide the model's parameters or layers across the new tensors. This could be done by:

1. Loading the model and identifying the layers or parameters to split.
2. Dividing the layers or parameters evenly so that each new tensor will have an approximately equal number of parameters or layers.
3. Saving the new tensors to disk.

In PyTorch, for example, you would:

1. Load the model using `torch.load`.
2. Access the state dictionary with `model.state_dict()`.
3. Identify the points at which to split the tensors. This could be done by layer or by parameter count.
4. Create new state dictionaries for each of the 8 parts.
5. Use `torch.save` to save each new state dictionary to a separate file.

If the tensors are not PyTorch model parameters but rather data, you would:

1. Load the tensors.
2. Determine the size of each tensor and calculate the split points.
3. Use slicing to create new tensors.
4. Save the new tensors.

The exact method depends on the structure of the tensors and the intended use of the split tensors. If the tensors are large and you are constrained by memory, you may need to use a streaming or chunking approach to avoid loading the entire tensor into memory at once.
