**Prompt:**
split 4 saftensors transformer llm files into 8

**Response:**
To split 4 SAFTensors (Sparse Attention Fast Transformers) files for a large language model (LLM) into 8, you would typically use a tool or script that can handle the specific format of the SAFTensors. Assuming the files are stored in a binary format that represents the sparse attention patterns or weights, you would need to:

1. Determine the structure of the SAFTensor files: Understand the schema, including how indices and values are stored, and any metadata.

2. Write a script or use a tool: Use a programming language like Python with appropriate libraries (e.g., NumPy for numerical operations, or specialized libraries if the tensors are in a format like PyTorch's `.pt` or TensorFlow's `.ckpt`).

3. Divide the tensors: The script should read in the tensors, divide them according to the desired split (e.g., by rows, columns, or blocks, depending on the tensor structure and the requirements of the LLM), and write out the new tensors to 8 separate files.

4. Validate the split: Ensure that the new tensors are valid and that no data has been lost or corrupted in the process. This might involve checksums, sanity checks on the shapes and sparsity patterns, or even loading them into the LLM to check that it performs as expected.

Without specific details on the format and structure of the SAFTensors, it's not possible to provide a more detailed process or code. If the files are in a proprietary or less common format, you may need to refer to documentation or reverse-engineer the format. If the tensors are part of a distributed system, additional steps may be required to ensure consistency across the system.
