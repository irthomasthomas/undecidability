**Prompt:**
split 4 safetensors  llm files into 8

**Response:**
To split 4 SafeTensors LLM files into 8, you would typically use a tool or programming language that can handle large file operations. Here's a high-level approach using Python with the `torch` library, assuming the SafeTensors are PyTorch tensor files:

1. Load each SafeTensor file using `torch.load`.
2. Determine the splitting point for each tensor (halfway through its length).
3. Slice each tensor into two parts at the splitting point.
4. Save each new tensor slice as a new SafeTensor file using `torch.save`.

Example code snippet:

```python
import torch

for i in range(1, 5):  # Assuming files are named llm1, llm2, llm3, llm4
    tensor = torch.load(f'llm{i}.pt')
    split_point = tensor.size(0) // 2  # Assuming the split is along the first dimension
    first_half = tensor[:split_point]
    second_half = tensor[split_point:]
    torch.save(first_half, f'llm{i}_part1.pt')
    torch.save(second_half, f'llm{i}_part2.pt')
```

This code assumes that the tensors are split along the first dimension, which is common for sequence data. Adjust the slicing as necessary for different tensor shapes or split criteria.
