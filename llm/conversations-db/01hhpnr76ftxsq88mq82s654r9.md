**Response:**
To unsource a shell file and unregister the functions, you can use the `unset` command followed by the function names. Here's the bash terminal command:

```bash
unset -f function_name1 function_name2 ...
```

Replace `function_name1`, `function_name2`, etc. with the actual names of the functions you want to unregister.
