**Prompt:**

This is a code block

```

**Response:**
It seems like you've indicated the start of a code block with three backticks (```). If you want to share some code or display text in a preformatted style, you can continue by typing your code after the backticks. Here's an example of how to use a code block in Markdown:

```python
# This is a simple Python function
def greet(name):
    return f"Hello, {name}!"

# Call the function
print(greet("World"))
```

When you use a code block in a platform that supports Markdown formatting (like GitHub, StackOverflow, or Markdown-enabled forums), the text within the backticks will be displayed in a monospaced font, and if you specify a language (like `python` in the example above), it may also be syntax-highlighted.
