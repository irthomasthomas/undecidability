**Prompt:**
Example python script 

**Response:**
Here is an example of a simple Python script that calculates the average of a list of numbers:

```python
def calculate_average(numbers):
    sum = 0
    for num in numbers:
        sum += num
    average = sum / len(numbers)
    return average

numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
average = calculate_average(numbers)
print("Average:", average)
```

In this script, there is a function called `calculate_average` which takes a list of numbers as input. It iterates over the numbers, adds them up to a variable `sum`, and then divides the sum by the length of the list to get the average. Finally, it returns the calculated average.

The script then defines a list of numbers `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]`, calls the `calculate_average` function with this list as the argument, and assigns the calculated average to a variable `average`. Finally, it prints the average value.
