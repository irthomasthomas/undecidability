**Prompt:**
pipe to standard in save_py.sh

**Response:**
To pipe content to standard input using a shell script, you can use the `echo` command along with the `|` symbol. Here's an example of a script named `save_py.sh` that pipes content to standard input:

```shell
#!/bin/bash

# Pipe content to standard input
echo "print('Hello, World!')" | python

# You can also save the output to a file
echo "print('Hello, World!')" | python > output.txt
```

In this example, the `echo` command sends the string `print('Hello, World!')` to standard output, which is then piped (`|`) to the `python` command as standard input. The Python interpreter will execute the code and produce the output accordingly. If you want to save the output to a file, you can use the redirection operator (`>`) to redirect the output stream of the `python` command to the `output.txt` file.

Make sure to make the script executable with the command `chmod +x save_py.sh`. Then, you can run the script using `./save_py.sh`.
