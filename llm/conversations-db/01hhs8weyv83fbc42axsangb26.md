**Prompt:**
Build enfuse-enblend with gpu support

**Response:**
Enfuse and Enblend do not support GPU acceleration natively. As of my knowledge cutoff in March 2023, there is no official GPU support for these tools. Building them with GPU support would require significant modification of the source code to offload certain computations to the GPU.

To build Enfuse/Enblend with GPU support, you would need to:

1. Identify parts of the code that are computationally intensive and could benefit from parallel processing on a GPU, such as image blending or exposure fusion algorithms.

2. Refactor the code to use a GPU-accelerated library or API, such as CUDA for NVIDIA GPUs or OpenCL for cross-platform GPU support.

3. Rewrite the algorithms to work with the GPU's parallel processing architecture, which may involve converting loops to kernel functions and managing memory transfers between the CPU and GPU.

4. Test the modified code for correctness and performance improvements.

5. Compile the modified code with the appropriate flags and libraries for GPU support.

This is a non-trivial task that would require expertise in both image processing and GPU programming. If you are not experienced in these areas, you might consider reaching out to the community or hiring a developer with the necessary skills. Alternatively, you could look for existing projects or forks of Enfuse/Enblend that may have started to implement GPU support.
