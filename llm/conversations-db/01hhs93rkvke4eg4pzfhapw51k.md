**Prompt:**
Build enfuse-enblend with opencl support

**Response:**
To build Enfuse/Enblend with OpenCL support, you will need to ensure that you have the necessary dependencies installed, including OpenCL headers and libraries, and then compile Enfuse/Enblend from source with OpenCL enabled. Here's a step-by-step guide:

1. **Install Dependencies**:
   - Ensure you have a C++ compiler, CMake, and the required libraries (libtiff, libpng, libjpeg, zlib, and OpenCL headers and libraries).
   - On Debian-based systems, you can install these using `apt`:
     ```
     sudo apt-get install build-essential cmake libtiff-dev libpng-dev libjpeg-dev zlib1g-dev opencl-headers
     ```
   - Ensure you have an OpenCL runtime for your GPU or CPU.

2. **Get Enfuse/Enblend Source**:
   - Clone the repository or download the source code from the official website or a mirror.

3. **Configure with CMake**:
   - Create a build directory and run `cmake` with the flag to enable OpenCL:
     ```
     mkdir build
     cd build
     cmake .. -DENABLE_OPENCL=ON
     ```
   - If OpenCL is not found automatically, you may need to set the paths to OpenCL headers and libraries manually.

4. **Compile**:
   - Run `make` to compile:
     ```
     make
     ```

5. **Install** (optional):
   - If you want to install it system-wide, run:
     ```
     sudo make install
     ```

6. **Verify OpenCL Support**:
   - Run `enblend --version` or `enfuse --version` to check if OpenCL support is mentioned.

If you encounter any errors during the configuration or compilation steps, you may need to troubleshoot by examining the error messages and ensuring all dependencies are correctly installed and accessible to the build system. If OpenCL detection is failing, you may need to specify the paths to your OpenCL installation manually in the CMake configuration step.
