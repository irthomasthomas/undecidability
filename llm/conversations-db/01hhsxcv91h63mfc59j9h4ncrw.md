How do I add multiple images to a krita document?

**Response:**
To add multiple images to a Krita document:

1. Open Krita and create a new document or open an existing one.
2. Go to `Layer` > `Import/Export` > `Import Layer...` or simply drag and drop images into the canvas.
3. Navigate to the location of your images, select them, and click `Open`. If dragging and dropping, do so from your file explorer to the Krita window.
4. Each image will be imported as a new layer. Arrange and edit as needed.

Repeat the import step for each image you want to add.
