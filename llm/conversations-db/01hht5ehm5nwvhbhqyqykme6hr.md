**Prompt:**
check gpu vram in arch terminal

**Response:**
To check the GPU VRAM in Arch Linux terminal, you can use the following commands:

1. Install the `mesa-utils` package if it is not already installed:
```
sudo pacman -S mesa-utils
```

2. Run the `glxinfo` command with the `-B` flag:
```
glxinfo -B
```

This will display detailed information about your GPU, including the VRAM size. Look for the "Video memory" field to see the VRAM size in kilobytes (KB).

Note: If you want a more user-friendly graphical interface for checking GPU information, you can install GPU-Z or other similar tools designed for this purpose.
