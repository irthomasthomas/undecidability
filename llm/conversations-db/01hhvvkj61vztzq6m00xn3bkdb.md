**Prompt:**
Boot arch to a lightweight terminal only shell

**Response:**
To boot Arch Linux to a lightweight terminal-only shell, you can follow these steps:

1. Start your computer and wait for the GRUB bootloader menu to appear.
2. Use the arrow keys to select the Arch Linux entry and press the "e" key to edit the boot parameters.
3. Locate the line that starts with "linux" or "linuxefi" and append "3" or "systemd.unit=multi-user.target" at the end of the line.
   - Adding "3" will boot into the default target, which is a multi-user, non-graphical target.
   - Adding "systemd.unit=multi-user.target" explicitly sets the target to multi-user.
4. Press "Ctrl + X" or "F10" to boot with the modified parameters.

This will boot Arch Linux into a lightweight terminal-only shell, without starting the graphical user interface.

**Prompt:**
can I achieve something similar without rebooting?

**Response:**
Yes, you can achieve a similar effect without rebooting by switching to a different TTY (terminal) in Arch Linux. Here's how you can do it:

1. Press "Ctrl + Alt + F2" to switch to TTY2. This will take you to a virtual terminal.
2. Log in with your username and password.
3. Once logged in, you will be in a text-based terminal without a graphical user interface.
4. To return to the default graphical TTY, press "Ctrl + Alt + F1" or "Ctrl + Alt + F7".

By switching to a different TTY, you can effectively work in a lightweight terminal-only environment without rebooting your system.

**Prompt:**
Can I kill the original tty to save ram?

**Response:**
No, killing the original TTY (graphical interface) will not save RAM. The TTY is an integral part of the operating system and terminating it would likely lead to system instability or unexpected behavior. Additionally, RAM usage is primarily determined by running processes, not the TTY itself.

If your goal is to reduce RAM usage, it's better to focus on closing unnecessary programs or processes that are consuming memory. You can use system monitoring tools like `htop` or `top` to identify resource-intensive processes and then terminate or suspend them if they are not essential.
