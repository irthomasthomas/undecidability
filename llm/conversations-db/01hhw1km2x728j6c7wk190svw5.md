ln -s /home/thomas/Development/Projects/llm/Models/OpenHermes-2.5-Mistral-7B-exl2 .
ln -s /home/thomas/Development/Projects/llm/Models/Mistral-7B-instruct-exl2 .
ln -s /home/thomas/Development/Projects/llm/Models/OpenHermes-2.5-neural-chat-v3-3-Slerp-exl2 .
ln -s /home/thomas/Development/Projects/llm/Models/TinyLlama-1.1B-intermediate-step-1195k-token-2.5T-exl2 .
ln -s /home/thomas/Development/Projects/llm/Models/Mistral-7B-Instruct-v0.2-DARE-3.0bpw-h6-exl2-2 .
ln -s /home/thomas/Development/Projects/llm/Models/Magicoder-S-DS-6.7B-4.0bpw-h6-exl2 .

# Verify the created links
ls -l
```

This script uses the `ln` command to create symbolic links (`-s` option) to the specified directories in the current directory. The `ls -l` command is then used to verify that the links were created successfully.
