```

**Prompt:**
How do I avoid that?

**Response:**
To avoid revoking the old user's access, you can modify the command to include both `new_user` and `old_user` as secondary groups for the `/home/old_user` directory. This can be achieved by using the `chgrp` command before changing ownership. Here's an example:

```bash
sudo chgrp -R new_user:old_user /home/old_user
sudo chown -R new_user:old_user /home/old_user
```

By doing this, both `new_user` and `old_user` will have access to the directory and its contents.
