**Prompt:**
what would be the effect of this command in arch: sudo chown -R new_user:old_user /home/old_user && sudo chgrp -R new_user:old_user /home/old_user

**Response:**
The command you've provided consists of two parts, combined using the `&&` operator, which means the second part will only execute if the first part completes without errors. The `&&` operator ensures that commands are run sequentially, and the second command runs only if the first one is successful.

Let's break down the command and its intended effects:

1. `sudo chown -R new_user:old_user /home/old_user`
    - This command changes the ownership of files and directories recursively (`-R`) within `/home/old_user` to the user `new_user` and the group `old_user`.
    - The `chown` command is used to change the owner of files or directories.
    - The `-R` flag stands for "recursive," meaning that the operation will be applied to all files and subdirectories inside the specified directory.

2. `sudo chgrp -R new_user:old_user /home/old_user`
    - This command is not entirely correct because the `chgrp` command's syntax does not support specifying a user, only a group. The intended purpose seems to be to change the group ownership of files and directories recursively within `/home/old_user` to the group `new_user`.
    - However, because of the incorrect syntax, this command would fail, and the group ownership would not be changed to `new_user`.
    - The correct form of the command should be just `sudo chgrp -R new_user /home/old_user` if you want to change the group ownership to `new_user`.

Assuming the first command (`sudo chown -R new_user:old_user /home/old_user`) is executed correctly, the owner of all files and directories under `/home/old_user` will be changed to `new_user`, and the group will be changed to `old_user`. However, because the second command (`sudo chgrp -R new_user:old_user /home/old_user`) contains a syntax error, it will fail, and the group ownership will not be changed a second time.

To summarize, the effective change after this command (assuming only the first part runs successfully) would be that the user `new_user` would become the new owner, and `old_user` would become the group owner of everything within `/home/old_user`. If you want to change both the user and group to `new_user`, the commands should look like this:

```bash
sudo chown -R new_user:new_user /home/old_user
```

This would change both the user and group ownership to `new_user` for all contents within `/home/old_user`.

**Prompt:**
will that lock out the old user from their files?

**Response:**
Yes, changing the ownership of files and directories as described by the `sudo chown -R new_user:old_user /home/old_user` command would effectively lock out the old user from their files if their permissions are restricted.

In UNIX-like systems such as Arch Linux, file permissions determine which users and groups can access and modify files and directories. Standard permissions include read (r), write (w), and execute (x), and they can be set differently for the owner (user), the group, and others.

When you change the owner of the files in `/home/old_user` to `new_user`, only the new owner (and root) will have the owner-level permissions that were originally granted to the old user. If the files do not grant group or other users' appropriate permissions (like read and write access), then the old user will no longer be able to modify or potentially even access their files, depending on the specific permissions set.

For example, if a file previously had the following permissions:

```
-rw------- 1 old_user old_user 0 Apr 4 12:00 file.txt
```

It means:
- User `old_user` has read and write permissions.
- Group `old_user` has no permissions.
- All other users have no permissions.

After the ownership change, `new_user` would have the read and write permissions, but the old owner would have no access if they are not part of the `old_user` group or if the group does not have access permissions.

To avoid locking out the old_user, you'd have to ensure that the group permissions (or others' permissions, which is much less secure) are set appropriately before changing the ownership, or add the old user to the new group if the group permissions allow the desired level of access.

To adjust permissions so that the old user retains access, you might set group permissions like so (if `old_user` remains a member of the `old_user` group):

```bash
sudo chmod -R g+rw /home/old_user
```

This command grants read and write permissions to the group for all files and directories recursively within `/home/old_user`. After changing the owner to `new_user`, as long as `old_user` remains in the `old_user` group, they will still have read and write access to the files based on group permissions.
