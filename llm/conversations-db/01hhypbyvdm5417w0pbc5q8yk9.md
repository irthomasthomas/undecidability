**Prompt:**
How to share a directory between all users on an arch install?

**Response:**
To share a directory between all users on an Arch Linux installation, you can follow these steps:

1. Create a new directory that you want to share. For example, you can use the command: `sudo mkdir /shared_directory`.

2. Set the appropriate permissions on the directory to allow all users to access it. You can use the command: `sudo chmod 777 /shared_directory`. Note that using `777` gives read, write, and execute permissions to everyone, so adjust the permissions according to your specific needs.

3. Modify the group ownership of the directory to a common group that all users belong to. For example, you can use the command: `sudo chgrp users /shared_directory`. The `users` group is a common group that all users are typically a part of in Arch Linux.

4. Set the group permissions on the directory to allow group members to access it. You can use the command: `sudo chmod g+rwX /shared_directory`. The `g+rwX` grants read and write permissions to the group, and the execute permission is set only if the directory already has the execute permission for the owner or group.

By following these steps, you should be able to share a directory between all users on your Arch Linux installation.
