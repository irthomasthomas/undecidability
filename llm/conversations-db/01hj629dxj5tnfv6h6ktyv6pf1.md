**Prompt:**
change default terminal to terminator


**Response:**
To change the default terminal emulator to Terminator in KDE Plasma, you can follow these steps:

1. Open System Settings: You can do this by clicking on the application launcher (often represented by the KDE logo) and typing "System Settings" into the search bar, then clicking on the System Settings icon.

2. Navigate to Applications: In the System Settings window, look for a section called "Applications" or "Default Applications" and click on it.

3. Change the Terminal Emulator: Within the Default Applications settings, you should see an option for "Terminal Emulator." Click on it, and you will be presented with a list of installed terminal emulators.

4. Select Terminator: If Terminator is installed on your system, it should appear in the list. Select it and apply the changes.

If Terminator is not listed, or if you prefer to use a command-line method, you can do the following:

1. Open the KDE configuration file for default applications in your favorite text editor. This file is typically located at `~/.config/kdeglobals`. You can open it with a command like:

   ```sh
   kate ~/.config/kdeglobals
   ```

   Replace `kate` with your preferred text editor if necessary.

2. Look for the `[General]` section in the file. If it doesn't exist, you can add it.

3. Add or modify the line that specifies the default terminal emulator. It should look like this:

   ```
   [General]
   TerminalApplication=terminator
   ```

4. Save the file and close the text editor.

5. To ensure the changes take effect, you may need to log out and log back in, or you can try to reload the KDE configuration with the following command:

   ```sh
   kbuildsycoca5 --noincremental
   ```

After completing these steps, Terminator should now be set as your default terminal emulator in KDE Plasma. When you use shortcuts or context menu options that launch a terminal, it should open Terminator instead of the previous default terminal emulator.
