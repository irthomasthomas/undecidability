**Prompt:**
This always opens terminator in centre: tdrop -x 0% -y 0% --width=48% --height=48% terminator

I want it to open in the top left corner. Write the new solution for me, I have no fingers.


**Response:**
If you want to open Terminator in the top left corner of your screen using `tdrop`, you would typically set the `-x` and `-y` options to position the window at the coordinates that correspond to the top left corner. By default, `0%` for both `-x` and `-y` should already position the window in the top left corner. However, if it's not working as expected, you might want to explicitly set the `-x` and `-y` values to `0`.

Here is the command that should open Terminator in the top left corner:

```sh
tdrop -x 0 -y 0 --width=48% --height=48% terminator
```

This command tells `tdrop` to open a Terminator window with the top left corner of the window at the `(0,0)` position of your screen, which is the top left corner of your display, and with a width and height that are 48% of your screen's width and height, respectively.

If this command does not position Terminator exactly how you want it, you may need to adjust the `--width` and `--height` percentages to account for any window decorations or panels that might be affecting the window's position.

XGetWindowProperty failed!^C

**Response:**
The error message "XGetWindowProperty failed!" indicates that `tdrop` is experiencing an issue when trying to communicate with the X server to manipulate window properties. This could be due to a variety of reasons such as X server configuration, issues with the window manager, or even permissions.

To debug this issue, you may consider the following steps:

1. Ensure `tdrop` is up to date:
   Make sure that you have the latest version of `tdrop` installed, as updates often fix bugs and improve compatibility.

2. Check Terminator installation:
   Make sure that Terminator is installed properly and that it can be started normally without `tdrop`.

3. Check X server and window manager:
   Verify that your X server and window manager are functioning correctly. As you're using KDE Plasma, you might be using KWin as your window manager. Make sure there are no conflicts between `tdrop` and KWin.

4. Run `tdrop` in a clean environment:
   Sometimes, other scripts or configurations (like those in your `.bashrc` or `.xinitrc`) might interfere with `tdrop`. Try running `tdrop` from a different terminal emulator or a virtual console (Ctrl+Alt+F2, F3, etc.) to see if the issue persists.

5. Check permissions:
   Ensure that your user has the necessary permissions to communicate with the X server. You can test this by running other X11-based commands and seeing if they function correctly.

6. Examine the logs:
   Look at the X server logs and possibly the `tdrop` logs (if it has verbose or debug options) for any additional information that could point to the source of the issue.

7. Use alternatives:
   If `tdrop` continues to fail, consider using alternative tools or scripts to achieve the desired window placement, or use the built-in window rules in KDE Plasma to position Terminator where you want it when it starts.

If you are not able to resolve the issue with these steps, it may be worth reaching out to the developer of `tdrop` or searching for similar issues in the `tdrop` GitHub repository's issues section for advice from users who might have faced the same problem.
