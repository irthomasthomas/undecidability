**Prompt:**
OPen terminator using one corner of screen

**Response:**
Use the `--geometry=GEOMETRY` option to specify the window size and position. Replace `GEOMETRY` with the appropriate geometry string (e.g., `80x24+0+0` for a window 80 characters wide and 24 characters tall positioned in the top-left corner of the screen).

Example:
```sh
terminator --geometry=80x24+0+0
```

**Prompt:**
I need it to be a fraction of my screen resolution

**Response:**
To place the Terminator window as a fraction of your screen resolution, you can use the `--geometry` option with the correct width, height, and X/Y offsets. If you don't have the exact values, you will need to calculate them based on your screen resolution.

For example, if you want Terminator to cover one quarter (1/4th) of your screen on the top left corner and your screen resolution is 1920x1080, divide the width and height by 2.

Example calculation:
- Width: 1920 / 2 = 960
- Height: 1080 / 2 = 540

To open Terminator with these dimensions in the top-left corner, use:
```sh
terminator --geometry=960x540+0+0
``` 

Adjust the numbers accordingly for other screen resolutions or different screen fractions.

**Prompt:**
write the code to get the screen res

**Response:**
To obtain the screen resolution on most Linux systems, you can use the `xdpyinfo` command combined with `awk` to extract the dimensions. Here's how you do it:

```sh
xdpyinfo | awk '/dimensions:/ {print $2}'
```

However, if you want to directly use the screen resolution to set Terminator's geometry, you would need to write a shell script to calculate the desired size. Below is an example script that gets the screen resolution, calculates half the width and height, and then launches Terminator:

```sh
#!/bin/bash

# Get screen resolution
res=$(xdpyinfo | grep 'dimensions:' | awk '{print $2}')
width=$(echo $res | cut -d'x' -f1)
height=$(echo $res | cut -d'x' -f2)

# Calculate half the width and height
new_width=$((width/2))
new_height=$((height/2))

# Launch Terminator
terminator --geometry=${new_width}x${new_height}+0+0
```

Make the script executable with `chmod +x <script_name>.sh` and run it to open Terminator with the size calculated as a fraction of your screen resolution. Adjust the calculations in the script as needed for different fractions of the screen.
