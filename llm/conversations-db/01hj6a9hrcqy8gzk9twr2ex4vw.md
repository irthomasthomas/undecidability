 Write a script that accepts TopLeft, TopRight, BtmLeft, BtmRight and uses tdrop to open terminator in the corners using the geometry flag and xdpyinfo to calculate the screen res

**Response:**
```bash
#!/bin/bash

# Usage: script.sh [TopLeft|TopRight|BtmLeft|BtmRight]

# Get screen resolution using xdpyinfo
read WIDTH HEIGHT <<< $(xdpyinfo | awk '/dimensions:/ { print $2 }' | tr 'x' ' ')

# Calculate half the width and height for positioning
HALF_WIDTH=$((WIDTH / 2))
HALF_HEIGHT=$((HEIGHT / 2))

# Function to calculate geometry based on position
calculate_geometry() {
  local position=$1
  local x y
  case $position in
    TopLeft)
      x=0
      y=0
      ;;
    TopRight)
      x=$HALF_WIDTH

# Use tdrop to open Terminator in the specified corner with the calculated geometry
tdrop -f "--geometry=$GEOMETRY" terminator
```

Make sure to give execute permission to the script with `chmod +x script.sh` before running it. Then you can run the script with one of the corner arguments, like `./script.sh TopLeft`.

Run the script with `./script.sh TopLeft` to open Terminator in the top-left corner of the screen, or use one of the other three corner arguments accordingly. Make sure the script has execute permissions with `chmod +x script.sh`.

still doesn't work. Format is like: tdrop -n "Terminator - Drop Down" -x 0% -y 0% --width=48% --height=48% --post-map-hook "wmctrl -r 'Terminator - Drop Down' -b add,sticky" terminator --geometry=${new_width}x${new_height}+0+0

**Response:**
Based on the provided working format and the requirement to open Terminator in the corners of the screen using `tdrop`, here's a complete script that incorporates the given format and calculates screen resolution to use the `--geometry` flag accordingly:

```bash
#!/bin/bash

# Get screen resolution
res=$(xdpyinfo | grep 'dimensions:' | awk '{print $2}')
width=$(echo $res | cut -d'x' -f1)
height=$(echo $res | cut -d'x' -f2)

# Calculate half the width and height
new_width=$((width / 2))
new_height=$((height / 2))

# Check if the provided argument corresponds to one of the corners
case "$1" in
  TopLeft)
    x_pos=0
    y_pos=0
    ;;
  TopRight)
    x_pos=$new_width
    y_pos=0
    ;;
  BtmLeft)
    x_pos=0
    y_pos=$new_height
    ;;
  BtmRight)
    x_pos=$new_width
    y_pos=$new_height
    ;;
  *)
    echo "Error: Please provide one of the following as an argument: 'TopLeft', 'TopRight', 'BtmLeft', 'BtmRight'."
    exit 1
    ;;
esac

# Set the name to identify the dropdown window
window_name="Terminator - Drop Down"

# Launch Terminator using tdrop with the calculated positions
tdrop -n "$window_name" -x ${x_pos} -y ${y_pos} --width=${new_width} --height=${new_height} --post-map-hook "wmctrl -r '$window_name' -b add,sticky" terminator --geometry=${new_width}x${new_height}+${x_pos}+${y_pos}
```

This script now uses the `tdrop` command with the `-x`, `-y`, `--width`, and `--height` options to set the position and size. The `--post-map-hook` option is included to stick the window, ensuring it remains on top. Make sure to give the script execute permission using `chmod +x script.sh` and then run it by passing one of the corner arguments, for example, `./script.sh TopLeft`.

**Prompt:**
That launches the terminator window ok, but when run it again it doesnt hide the window it opens a new window

**Response:**
To ensure `tdrop` toggles the visibility of the existing Terminator window instead of opening a new one, you need to use a consistent name for the dropdown session with `-n` that `tdrop` can reference. Also, ensure `tdrop` is used without a specific geometry setup when you want to hide an existing window. Here is your modified script:

```bash
#!/bin/bash

# Get screen resolution
res=$(xdpyinfo | grep 'dimensions:' | awk '{print $2}')
width=$(echo $res | cut -d'x' -f1)
height=$(echo $res | cut -d'x' -f2)

# Calculate half the width and height
new_width=$((width / 2))
new_height=$((height / 2))

# Window/session name for dropdown
window_name="Terminator-Drop-Down"

# Position calculation based on corner
case "$1" in
  TopLeft)
    geometry="${new_width}x${new_height}+0+0"
    ;;
  TopRight)
    geometry="${new_width}x${new_height}+${new_width}+0"
    ;;
  BtmLeft)
    geometry="${new_width}x${new_height}+0+${new_height}"
    ;;
  BtmRight)
    geometry="${new_width}x${new_height}+${new_width}+${new_height}"
    ;;
  *)
    echo "Error: Invalid argument. Please provide one of the following: 'TopLeft', 'TopRight', 'BtmLeft', 'BtmRight'."
    exit 1
    ;;
esac

# Use tdrop to toggle the visibility of the existing window or create a new one
# Passes the window/session name and relevant commands to ensure a singular instance
tdrop -a -n "$window_name" -s "tmux new-session" terminator --geometry=${geometry}
```

This script should now toggle the visibility of the specified corner Terminator window. When called with the same argument, it should hide the currently visible window or show it if it's hidden, rather than opening a new one.

Remember to set the script as executable with `chmod +x script.sh` and then you can run it with `./script.sh TopLeft` or any other corner argument.

If multiple instances are still being created instead of just toggling, you might want to ensure `tdrop` and your window manager or desktop environment is correctly configured to handle window identification. Make sure that `tdrop` is the latest version and your WM supports its functionalities.

**Prompt:**
im using terminator, not tmux

**Response:**
I apologize for the confusion. In the case that you're using Terminator and want to toggle the window visibility using `tdrop`, you need to ensure that each `tdrop` command refers to the same window session using its name. Here's the revised script:

```bash
#!/bin/bash

# Define a consistent window name to be used by tdrop
window_name="TerminatorDropDown"

# Function to calculate geometry
calculate_geometry() {
    local position=$1
    local res width height new_width new_height x_pos y_pos

    res=$(xdpyinfo | grep 'dimensions:' | awk '{print $2}')
    width=$(echo $res | cut -d'x' -f1)
    height=$(echo $res | cut -d'x' -f2)
    
    new_width=$((width / 2))
    new_height=$((height / 2))

    case $position in
        TopLeft)
            x_pos=0
            y_pos=0
            ;;
        TopRight)
            x_pos=$((width / 2))
            y_pos=0
            ;;
        BtmLeft)
            x_pos=0
            y_pos=$((height / 2))
            ;;
        BtmRight)
            x_pos=$((width / 2))
            y_pos=$((height / 2))
            ;;
        *)
            echo "Invalid corner specified."
            exit 1
            ;;
    esac

    echo "${new_width}x${new_height}+${x_pos}+${y_pos}"
}

# Check if the provided argument is a valid corner
if [[ "$1" =~ ^(TopLeft|TopRight|BtmLeft|BtmRight)$ ]]; then
    # Calculate the appropriate geometry for the chosen corner
    geometry=$(calculate_geometry $1)
    # Use tdrop to either create the Terminator window or toggle its visibility
    tdrop -a -n "$window_name" -w "${new_width}" -h "${new_height}" terminator --geometry=${geometry} 
else
    echo "Usage: $0 [TopLeft|TopRight|BtmLeft|BtmRight]"
    exit 1
fi
```

Run this script with a corner argument (`TopLeft`, `TopRight`, `BtmLeft`, `BtmRight`) to toggle the visibility of the Terminator window in the specified screen corner. Make sure to grant execution permissions with `chmod +x script.sh`.

This script calculates the screen dimensions, creates the necessary geometry string, and passes it along with a consistent session name to `tdrop`. When `tdrop` is run again with the same `window_name`, it should recognize the existing window and toggle it instead of making a new one.

**Prompt:**
XGetWindowProperty failed

**Response:**
The `XGetWindowProperty failed` error suggests there could be a problem with window management on X11. This issue might not be related to the script itself but to how `tdrop` or your window manager is handling the window properties.

Here are some troubleshooting steps to resolve this issue:

1. Ensure that `xdotool` and `wmctrl` are installed on your system, as `tdrop` may rely on these tools to manage windows:

   ```bash
   sudo apt-get install xdotool wmctrl
   ```

2. Confirm that your window manager or desktop environment is compatible with `tdrop` and the tools mentioned above.

3. Make sure your `tdrop` version is up to date:

   ```bash
   tdrop --version
   ```

4. Ensure that `tdrop` is not creating multiple windows with the same name. It needs to be able to uniquely identify the window you want to toggle.

If you're still encountering this error, try to simplify the usage of `tdrop` by calling it outside the script with basic arguments to check if it's working properly as expected. Once you've isolated the issue, you can then incorporate it back into your script.

For example, try something very basic like:

```bash
tdrop -n "TerminatorDropDown" terminator
```

Run this command twice; it should create the window the first time and then hide it upon subsequent invocation.

If the issue persists, consider checking the documentation or support forums for both `tdrop` and your window manager for compatibility notes or known issues.
