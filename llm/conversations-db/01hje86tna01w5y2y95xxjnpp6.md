**Prompt:**
Help: sshd -t                                                                                                 ✔  base 
sshd: no hostkeys available -- exiting.

**Response:**
The error message "sshd: no hostkeys available -- exiting." indicates that the SSH daemon (sshd) cannot find any host keys necessary for starting the SSH service. Host keys are used to identify the server to clients during the SSH handshake process.

To resolve this issue, generate new host keys using the `ssh-keygen` command. Typically, you would generate RSA, ECDSA, and ED25519 keys. Run the following commands as root or with sudo:

```sh
ssh-keygen -t rsa -f /etc/ssh/ssh_host_rsa_key
ssh-keygen -t ecdsa -f /etc/ssh/ssh_host_ecdsa_key
ssh-keygen -t ed25519 -f /etc/ssh/ssh_host_ed25519_key
```

After generating the keys, ensure the permissions are correct:

```sh
chmod 600 /etc/ssh/ssh_host_*_key
```

Then, try starting the SSH service again or re-run `sshd -t` to test the configuration. If the issue persists, check the sshd_config file for the correct paths to the host keys.
