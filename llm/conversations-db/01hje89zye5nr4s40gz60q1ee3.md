Help: where does it look for keys in arch? :  sshd -t                                                                                                 ✔  base 
sshd: no hostkeys available -- exiting.

**Response:**
`sshd -t` checks the configuration for syntax errors and validity. The error "no hostkeys available -- exiting" indicates that `sshd` cannot find any host keys necessary for starting the SSH daemon.

By default, `sshd` looks for host keys in `/etc/ssh/`. The specific files it looks for include:

- `/etc/ssh/ssh_host_rsa_key`
- `/etc/ssh/ssh_host_ecdsa_key`
- `/etc/ssh/ssh_host_ed25519_key`

If these files are missing, you can generate new host keys using the `ssh-keygen` command. For example:

```bash
ssh-keygen -t rsa -f /etc/ssh/ssh_host_rsa_key
ssh-keygen -t ecdsa -f /etc/ssh/ssh_host_ecdsa_key
ssh-keygen -t ed25519 -f /etc/ssh/ssh_host_ed25519_key
```

Ensure the permissions are correct (readable only by root) and then try running `sshd -t` again.

**Prompt:**
those files are present

**Response:**
If the host keys exist but `sshd -t` cannot find them, check the following:

1. Permissions: Host key files should have read permission for root only (0600).
2. Ownership: Host key files should be owned by the `root` user and the `root` group (or the user/group under which `sshd` is running).
3. SELinux/AppArmor: If SELinux or AppArmor is enabled, ensure that it is not preventing access to the keys.
4. Configuration: The `sshd_config` file might have been modified to look for keys elsewhere. Check for `HostKey` directives that may point to non-standard locations.
5. SSH Key Format: Keys might be in an unsupported or corrupt format. Regenerate as a last resort if all else fails.

To diagnose, run `sshd` in debug mode (`sshd -d`) or check system logs for detailed error messages.

sshd re-exec requires execution with an absolute path

**Response:**
The error message indicates that when trying to run `sshd` in debug mode with `sshd -d`, it needs to be executed with an absolute path to the `sshd` binary. This is a security measure.

You should specify the full path to the `sshd` executable. You can find this by running `which sshd` or `type -a sshd`. This will give you the full path to the binary, which is typically `/usr/sbin/sshd`.

Then, execute it with the absolute path:

```bash
/usr/sbin/sshd -d
```

This should allow `sshd` to start in debug mode and provide more verbose output that can help diagnose the issue with the host keys.

**Prompt:**
debug1: sshd version OpenSSH_9.6, OpenSSL 3.2.0 23 Nov 2023
debug1: Unable to load host key: /etc/ssh/ssh_host_rsa_key
debug1: Unable to load host key: /etc/ssh/ssh_host_ecdsa_key
debug1: Unable to load host key: /etc/ssh/ssh_host_ed25519_key
sshd: no hostkeys available -- exiting.

**Response:**
The debug output suggests that `sshd` cannot load the host keys even though they exist. To address this:

- Confirm the permissions are correct with `ls -l /etc/ssh/ssh_host_*_key`. They should be `-rw-------` and owned by `root:root`.
- Verify the integrity and format of the keys using `ssh-keygen -yl -f /etc/ssh/ssh_host_rsa_key` for each key type.
- If SELinux or AppArmor is active, check their logs for denials (`ausearch -m avc -ts recent` for SELinux or `/var/log/audit/audit.log`).
- If the keys were recently generated or changed, try restarting the sshd service.
- If using a non-default `sshd_config`, confirm that it correctly specifies the host keys.

If necessary, back up existing keys and regenerate them again as shown earlier and ensure proper permissions/ownership are set:

```bash
mv /etc/ssh/ssh_host_* /backup/
ssh-keygen -t rsa -f /etc/ssh/ssh_host_rsa_key -N ""
ssh-keygen -t ecdsa -f /etc/ssh/ssh_host_ecdsa_key -N ""
ssh-keygen -t ed25519 -f /etc/ssh/ssh_host_ed25519_key -N ""
chmod 600 /etc/ssh/ssh_host_*_key
chown root:root /etc/ssh/ssh_host_*_key
``` 

If the issue persists after these checks, consider examining the sshd_config for any anomalies, consult system logs, and validate the sshd binary.

ssh-keygen: /etc/ssh/ssh_host_rsa_key: Permission denied

**Response:**
The permission denied error indicates the current user does not have read access to `/etc/ssh/ssh_host_rsa_key`. Host key files usually have strict permissions for security reasons and can only be read by the root user.

Try running the `ssh-keygen -yl -f /etc/ssh/ssh_host_rsa_key` command with `sudo` to execute it with root privileges:

```bash
sudo ssh-keygen -yl -f /etc/ssh/ssh_host_rsa_key
```

Repeat this process for each host key file:

```bash
sudo ssh-keygen -yl -f /etc/ssh/ssh_host_ecdsa_key
sudo ssh-keygen -yl -f /etc/ssh/ssh_host_ed25519_key
```

This should provide the fingerprint and details of each host key, confirming their integrity and correct format. If there's still an issue, the output might suggest corruption or format incompatibility.
