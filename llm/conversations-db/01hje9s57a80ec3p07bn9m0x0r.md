**Prompt:**
enable port 22 on firewalld on arch

**Response:**
To enable port 22 on firewalld on Arch Linux, execute the following commands as root or with sudo:

1. Check if firewalld is running:
   ```
   systemctl status firewalld
   ```

2. If it's not running, start and enable it:
   ```
   systemctl start firewalld
   systemctl enable firewalld
   ```

3. Add the rule to allow port 22 (SSH):
   ```
   firewall-cmd --permanent --zone=public --add-port=22/tcp
   ```

4. Reload firewalld to apply the changes:
   ```
   firewall-cmd --reload
   ```

Verify that the rule has been added:
```
firewall-cmd --list-all
```

Port 22 should now be allowed through the firewall.

**Prompt:**
ssh: connect to host 90.244.175.140 port 22: Connection refused

**Response:**
The message "ssh: connect to host 90.244.175.140 port 22: Connection refused" indicates that the SSH client cannot establish a connection to the specified IP address on port 22 because the connection attempt is being rejected. Possible reasons include:

- **SSH service is not running**: Ensure that the SSH daemon (`sshd`) is running on the server with `systemctl status sshd`.
- **Firewall blocking**: Even after adding the rule on your local firewall, there could be another firewall on the network or on the host that is still blocking port 22.
- **Incorrect IP address**: Confirm the IP address is correct and that it is the intended machine.
- **SSH listening on different port**: Check if SSH daemon is listening on a different port with `sshd_config` file or by running `netstat -tuln | grep ssh`.
- **TCP wrappers restrictions**: `/etc/hosts.allow` or `/etc/hosts.deny` could be restricting access.
- **SELinux**: If enforced, could be blocking the connection.
- **Service failure**: SSH service could have failed to start properly. Check logs with `journalctl -u sshd`.

To further diagnose, try connecting with verbose mode enabled:
```
ssh -vvv user@90.244.175.140
```

The verbose output should provide more information on where the connection attempt is failing.

**Response:**
The verbose output confirms that the SSH client is attempting to connect to 90.244.175.140 on port 22, but the connection is refused. Since SSH configuration and relevant files appear to be read correctly, and there's no mention of a timeout or SSH key exchange, the refusal is happening immediately upon trying to connect. The issue likely lies with the server or network configuration.

Next steps:

- Verify that the SSH server is running on 90.244.175.140 with `systemctl status sshd`.
- Ensure the SSH server is listening on port 22 with `sudo ss -tuln | grep :22` on the server.
- Check the server's firewall settings (e.g., `sudo iptables -L` or `firewall-cmd --list-all`) to ensure inbound connections on port 22 are allowed.
- Confirm there are no middleboxes (router or firewall) between the client and server blocking port 22.
- Examine the server's `/etc/ssh/sshd_config` for any configuration that might refuse connections (e.g., `ListenAddress`, `AllowUsers`, `AllowGroups`, `PasswordAuthentication`, etc.).
- Check the server's `/etc/hosts.allow` and `/etc/hosts.deny` to see if the client IP is blocked.
- If SELinux is enabled, confirm it's not blocking the connection with `sestatus` and checking relevant logs in `/var/log/audit/audit.log`.
- Retry connecting from a different IP or network to rule out local network issues.

**Response:**
The firewalld configuration output indicates that the `public` zone is active and has `ssh` listed in the services, which implies that port 22 should be open for SSH connections on the network interface `enp5s0`.

Given this configuration, if the SSH connection is still being refused, consider the following:

- **SSH Service**: Ensure the SSH service (`sshd`) is active and properly configured to listen on port 22 on the server.
- **Fail2ban or Similar Tools**: Check if the server is running any auto-banning software that might have banned your IP.
- **Server-Side Firewall**: Apart from firewalld, ensure no other firewall service is running and interfering with SSH connections.
- **Confirm IP Binding**: Check `/etc/ssh/sshd_config` for the `ListenAddress` directive to confirm that `sshd` is configured to listen on the server's IP address or `0.0.0.0` (all interfaces).

If these checks do not resolve the issue, examine the server logs for `sshd` (typically `/var/log/auth.log` or `journalctl -u sshd`) for any messages related to connection attempts. This may identify why the connection is being refused.

**Prompt:**
ssh thomas@127.0.0.1

**Response:**
If you are trying to SSH into the localhost (the machine you are currently using) using the IP address `127.0.0.1`, and you have SSH service (sshd) running and configured to listen on the standard port 22, this command should initiate an SSH session to your local machine.

Check that your `sshd` service is running with `systemctl status sshd` or attempt to start it with `systemctl start sshd`. If you've configured `sshd` to listen on a non-standard port, you'll need to specify that port with the `-p` option like `ssh thomas@127.0.0.1 -p <port_number>`.

Local firewalls typically do not block connections to 127.0.0.1, but if you have customized your firewall settings, check that local connections are not being blocked. If successful, you should be prompted for the user `thomas`'s password or, if SSH keys are set up for authentication, the key passphrase.

**Prompt:**
I still cannot connect using the external ip

**Response:**
Since you can connect using the local IP (`127.0.0.1`) but not the external IP, check the following on the SSH server:

1. **Listen Address**: Verify `sshd` is not only listening on the loopback address. Check `/etc/ssh/sshd_config`:
   - `ListenAddress 0.0.0.0` to listen on all available IPv4 addresses.
   - `ListenAddress ::` to listen on all available IPv6 addresses.
   - Then restart `sshd`: `systemctl restart sshd`.

2. **Server IP Address**: Confirm the server's external IP with `ip addr` or `ifconfig`.

3. **Network Firewall/Router**: If the server is behind a router or a different network firewall:
   - Ensure the router is forwarding port 22 to the server's internal IP address.
   - Temporarily disable any software-based firewall (like `ufw`) on the server to rule it out: `ufw disable` or `systemctl stop firewalld`.

4. **ISP or Hosting Provider**: Verify with your ISP or hosting provider that inbound connections on port 22 are not blocked.

5. **TCP Wrappers**: Check `/etc/hosts.allow` and `/etc/hosts.deny` for any rules.

6. **SELinux**: If SELinux is enabled, check it's not causing issues with `sestatus` and `ausearch -m avc -ts recent`.

7. **SSH Server Logs**: Inspect SSH server logs for any connection attempts or errors with `journalctl -u sshd` or by looking in `/var/log/auth.log`.

Isolate the issue by ruling out each of these potential causes one at a time. If none of these steps reveal the problem, consider testing with another device in the same network, which can help determine if the issue is with the server or the path the connection takes from the client to the server.

what do I do after changing sshd_config?

**Response:**
After editing `sshd_config`, you need to restart the SSH daemon for changes to take effect.

Use the following command to restart `sshd`:
```
systemctl restart sshd
``` 

Verify that the service restarted without issues:
```
systemctl status sshd
```

After restarting `sshd`, you can attempt to connect again using the server's external IP address.

**Response:**
The `sshd` service is active and listening on both IPv4 and IPv6 addresses, yet the connection to the external IP (`90.244.175.140`) is refused. 

Next steps:

1. **Check Server's External IP**: Ensure `90.244.175.140` is the current external IP of the server. IP addresses may change, especially if DHCP is used or if dealing with an ISP that changes your IP frequently.

2. **Router Configuration**: If the server is behind a router doing Network Address Translation (NAT), make sure Port Forwarding is set up correctly on the router to forward SSH traffic on port 22 to the server's internal IP address.

3. **Network Firewalls**: Some ISPs may block port 22. Try connecting to the server from a different network, or contact the ISP to verify if they block the SSH port. Alternatively, consider changing the SSH port in `sshd_config` to a non-standard port and update firewall rules accordingly.

4. **SSH on Different Port**: If port 22 has been changed to a non-standard port, ensure you are using the `-p` flag followed by the new port number when attempting to connect via SSH.

5. **Test from Another Network**: To rule out local network issues, attempt to SSH into `90.244.175.140` from a different network, if possible.

If none of these steps reveal the issue, it might be necessary to review any intermediate network devices' configuration or check with the ISP or hosting provider for further assistance.

Dec 24 16:44:54 Desk sshd[274881]: Server listening on 0.0.0.0 port 22.

**Response:**
The `sshd` service is running, and the SSH server is listening on all available interfaces on port 22. Since connections to `127.0.0.1` succeed and `90.244.175.140` fails:

- **Double-check IP Address**: Confirm that `90.244.175.140` is indeed the correct external IP address of the server.
- **Port Forwarding**: If the server is behind a router or a NAT, ensure port forwarding is correctly configured to forward port 22 to the server's internal IP.
- **ISP/Network Restrictions**: Confirm there are no ISP-level restrictions or ISP equipment blocking port 22.
- **Firewalls**: Confirm any other firewalls in the network aren't blocking connections.
- **Connect Locally with External IP**: Test connecting to `90.244.175.140` from within the local network, this can sometimes succeed even when external attempts fail, indicating NAT or firewall issues.

If local attempts to connect to the external IP also fail, this points towards a configuration issue on the server or local network, rather than an external block.
