**Prompt:**
I can connect to my sshd using localhost but not the external ip. How might I fix this on arch linux or in the technicolor router?

**Response:**
To fix the issue of not being able to connect to your SSH server using the external IP on Arch Linux, you need to check and configure the following:

1. Firewall: Ensure that the firewall on your Arch Linux system allows incoming connections on the SSH port (default is port 22). You can use the `ufw` or `iptables` command to configure the firewall rules accordingly.

2. SSH Configuration: Check the SSH server configuration file (`/etc/ssh/sshd_config`) and make sure that the `ListenAddress` directive is set to the external IP address of your Arch Linux system. If it is set to `localhost` or `127.0.0.1`, change it to the external IP.

3. Router Configuration: If you are using a Technicolor router, you need to configure port forwarding to forward incoming SSH traffic from the router's external IP to your Arch Linux system's internal IP. Access your router's administration interface, locate the port forwarding settings, and create a rule to forward port 22 (or the custom SSH port if you have changed it) to the internal IP address of your Arch Linux system.

4. Dynamic IP: If your external IP address is dynamic (changes frequently), consider using a dynamic DNS service to associate a domain name with your external IP. This way, you can always connect to your SSH server using the domain name instead of the changing IP address.

Remember to restart the SSH service (`systemctl restart sshd`) and test the connection using the external IP after making these changes.

**Prompt:**
I forword the port on the router, so why would set the external address in listenaddress?

**Response:**
Apologies for the confusion. If you have already forwarded the SSH port on your router, you do not need to set the external IP address in the SSH server configuration file.

In this case, you can leave the `ListenAddress` directive in the SSH server configuration file (`/etc/ssh/sshd_config`) as it is, which is usually set to the default value of `0.0.0.0` or commented out. This configuration allows SSH to listen on all available network interfaces, including the external interface.

Ensure that you have set up the port forwarding correctly on your Technicolor router, forwarding incoming connections on port 22 (or the custom SSH port if you have changed it) to the internal IP address of your Arch Linux system.

Restart the SSH service (`systemctl restart sshd`) and test the connection using the external IP. If you still cannot connect, make sure the firewall on your Arch Linux system allows incoming connections on the SSH port.
