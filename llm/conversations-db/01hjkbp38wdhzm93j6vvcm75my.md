Create a shell script that checks for broken file linke and attempts to heal them with a search for the dir in the parent dirs

Additional Goals:
  - Minimise code dependencies.
  - Use optimised code.
  - Minimise branching and process forking.
  - Use self-documenting code.


**Response:**
Certainly. The following Bash script aims to check for broken symbolic links within a given directory and attempts to fix them by searching for files with the same name in the parent directories.

```bash
#!/bin/bash

# The function 'find_broken_links' will search for broken symbolic links
find_broken_links() {
    local path="${1:-.}" # Default to current directory if no argument is provided
    # Find all files that are broken links in a given directory
    find "$path" -xtype l 2>/dev/null
}

# The function 'attempt_heal' tries to locate a file with the same name in the parent directories
attempt_heal() {
    local broken_link="$1"
    local link_target="$(readlink "$broken_link")"
    local link_name="$(basename "$link_target")"
    local current_dir="$(dirname "$broken_link")"
    
    # Ascend up the directory structure
    while [[ "$current_dir" != "/" ]]; do 
        current_dir=$(dirname "$current_dir") # Move up one directory level
        
        # Search for file with same name in ancestor directory
        local possible_fix=$(find "$current_dir" -maxdepth 1 -type f -name "$link_name" -print -quit)
        
        if [[ -n "$possible_fix" ]]; then
            # If a file is found, create a new link
            ln -sf "$possible_fix" "$broken_link"
            echo "Repaired: $broken_link -> $possible_fix"
            return 0
        fi
    done
    
    echo "Failed to repair: $broken_link" >&2
    return 1
}

# Main loop that processes each broken link
main() {
    local dir_to_search="${1:-.}" # Default directory to search is the current one

    # Processing all broken links
    while read -r broken_link; do
        attempt_heal "$broken_link"
    done < <(find_broken_links "$dir_to_search")
}

# Entry point: Pass the search directory or use current directory by default
main "$@"
```

This script is a command-line utility that takes an optional argument representing the directory to search. It then proceeds with the following steps:

1. `find_broken_links` uses `find` to locate broken symbolic links. It suppresses error outputs and only looks for links (`-xtype l`).

2. `attempt_heal` reads the location where the broken link points (`link_target`) and its base name (`link_name`). It then traverses up the directory structure, searching for a file with the same name using `find` with a `-maxdepth 1` constraint to minimize the scope of the search.

3. If a potential replacement is found (`possible_fix`), a new symbolic link is created using `ln -sf`, and a message is printed indicating the repair.

4. If a repair is not possible, an error message is printed to STDERR.

5. The `main` function orchestrates the operations, using process substitution `< <(command)` to avoid creating subshells that fork additional processes.

6. Finally, the script is executed with an optional directory argument or defaults to the current directory.

To use this script, save it as a file, for example, `fix_broken_links.sh`, then make it executable with `chmod +x fix_broken_links.sh`. Invoke the script with an optional directory argument:

```bash
./fix_broken_links.sh /path/to/search
```

or simply,

```bash
./fix_broken_links.sh
```

for the current directory.
