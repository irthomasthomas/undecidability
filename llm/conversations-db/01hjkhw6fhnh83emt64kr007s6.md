**Prompt:**
Here is a nyxt browser script. Update it to include the selection buffer in the copy operation: (define-command copy-url
    nil
  "Save current URL to clipboard."
  (copy-to-clipboard (render-url (url (current-buffer))))
  (echo "~a copied to clipboard." (render-url (url (current-buffer)))))

**Response:**
To include the selection buffer in the copy operation, you need to adjust the `copy-url` command to check if there is any active selection and copy that to the clipboard instead of the current URL. If there is no selection, then it will default to copying the URL as originally intended.

Here's an updated version of the script:

```lisp
(define-command copy-url
    nil
  "Save current URL or the selection to clipboard."
  (let ((selection (buffer-get-clipboard-contents (current-buffer))))
    (if selection
      (progn
        (copy-to-clipboard selection)
        (echo "Selection copied to clipboard."))
      (progn
        (copy-to-clipboard (render-url (url (current-buffer))))
        (echo "~a copied to clipboard." (render-url (url (current-buffer))))))))
```

This script defines a variable `selection` which retrieves the selection from the current buffer using `buffer-get-clipboard-contents`. If `selection` contains a non-nil value (i.e., there is a selection), then that selection is copied to the clipboard, and a message is echoed to the user indicating that the selection was copied. If there is no selection, it falls back to copying the URL of the current buffer and echoing that to the user.
