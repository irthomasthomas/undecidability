**Prompt:**
Write an interesting and unique shell function that uses curl

**Response:**
Function: `weather_report`

Purpose: Fetches and displays a weather report for a specified location using the `wttr.in` service.

```sh
weather_report() {
  local location="${1:-}"
  [ -z "$location" ] && location="$(curl -s ipinfo.io/city)"
  curl -s "wttr.in/${location}?format=3"
}
```

Usage: Call `weather_report` with a location as an argument to get the weather for that location. If no argument is provided, it uses IP geolocation to determine the city.

Example:
```sh
weather_report "Tokyo"
```

This function makes an educated guess about the userâ€™s location if no argument is provided. The `wttr.in` service returns a simple string describing the current weather, which is suitable for inclusion in shell prompts or status lines.
