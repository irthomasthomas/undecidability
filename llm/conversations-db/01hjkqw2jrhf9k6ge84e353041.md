**Prompt:**
Write an interesting and unique shell command that uses curl and public apis

**Response:**
```sh
curl -s 'https://api.agify.io/?name=elon' | jq '. | {name, age_estimate: .age}'
```

This shell command makes a call to the 'agify.io' API to estimate the age of the name givenâ€”in this case, "Elon". It uses `curl` to perform the HTTP request and `jq` to format the JSON response by extracting and renaming the 'age' field to 'age_estimate' while keeping the 'name'. This could be of interest for demographic analysis or just curiosity about age distributions of names.
