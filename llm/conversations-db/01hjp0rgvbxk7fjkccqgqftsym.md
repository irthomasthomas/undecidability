**Prompt:**
Reset visual studio code back to clean defaults?


**Response:**
To reset Visual Studio Code (VS Code) to its default settings, you will need to clear your user settings and possibly uninstall and reinstall the application if you want a complete reset. Here's how you can do it:

1. **Clear User Settings:**
   - Close VS Code.
   - Navigate to the VS Code user settings directory:
     - On Linux: `~/.config/Code/User/`
   - Delete the `settings.json` file to reset your settings to default.
   - You may also want to delete the `keybindings.json` file if you have custom keybindings that you want to reset.

2. **Clear Extensions:**
   - Still within the `~/.config/Code/` directory, you will find an `extensions` folder.
   - Delete this folder to remove all installed extensions.

3. **Clear Workspace Settings:**
   - Workspace settings are stored in the `.vscode` folder within your project's directory.
   - Navigate to your project directory and delete the `.vscode` folder if you want to reset settings for a specific project.

4. **Reinstall Visual Studio Code:**
   - If you want to ensure a completely clean state, you can uninstall and then reinstall VS Code.
   - To uninstall VS Code, you can use your package manager. For example, if you installed it via `pacman`, you would run:
     ```
     sudo pacman -Rns code
     ```
   - After uninstalling, you can reinstall it using the same package manager:
     ```
     sudo pacman -S code
     ```

5. **Clear VS Code Cache (Optional):**
   - If you want to go a step further, you can also clear VS Code's cache.
   - The cache is located at `~/.config/Code/Cache` and `~/.config/Code/CachedData`.
   - Delete these directories to clear the cache.

Remember to back up any important data before you delete it, just in case you want to restore some of your settings or extensions later. After performing these steps, you will have a fresh VS Code installation with default settings.
