**Prompt:**
Which is the best command to use to get info about a window? Command1:
xdotool getwindowname $(xdotool getactivewindow)

command2:xwininfo -tree -root


**Response:**
Both commands serve different purposes and provide different types of information about windows in a Linux X11 environment. The best command to use depends on the specific information you are looking for.

Command 1: `xdotool getwindowname $(xdotool getactivewindow)`
This command uses `xdotool` to first get the ID of the currently active window (the window that has focus) and then retrieves the name (title) of that window. This is useful if you want to know the title of the window you are currently working with.

Command 2: `xwininfo -tree -root`
This command uses `xwininfo` to provide detailed information about the window hierarchy starting from the root window (the whole screen). It lists all the windows managed by the X server in a tree structure, including their IDs, names, and other properties. This is useful if you want to get an overview of all windows and how they are related to each other.

If you want to get the name of the active window, the first command is more appropriate. If you want to get detailed information about all windows, the second command is better suited for that purpose.
