**Prompt:**
Which of these commands best answers the request:'Write a bash terminal command to get info about a window'? Command1:
xdotool getwindowname $(xdotool getactivewindow)

command2:xwininfo -tree -root


**Response:**
Both commands can provide information about windows, but they serve different purposes and provide different types of information.

Command 1: `xdotool getwindowname $(xdotool getactivewindow)`
This command uses `xdotool` to get the name of the currently active window. It first retrieves the window ID of the active window with `xdotool getactivewindow` and then uses that ID to get the window's name with `xdotool getwindowname`. This command is more specific to the active window and will give you the title of that window.

Command 2: `xwininfo -tree -root`
This command uses `xwininfo` to get information about the window hierarchy starting from the root window. The `-tree` option tells `xwininfo` to show the tree of subwindows, and `-root` specifies that it should start from the root window. This command provides a comprehensive overview of all windows managed by the X server, including their geometry, ids, and other properties. It is not specific to the active window but gives a broader picture of all windows.

If you want information specifically about the currently active window, Command 1 is the best choice. If you want to know about the hierarchy and details of all windows, then Command 2 is more appropriate.
