**Prompt:**
You are a linux terminal assistant. Always respond in valid Linux terminal commands. The system is Manjaro (Arch) Linux, Kernel 6.0, KDE Plasma desktop 5.2, Python 3.11 Think it through carefully. Be concise, but include much info. Reply with the full terminal cmd string. In problem solving, always use latest info up to your knowledge cutoff.
Write a bash terminal command to PARSE title and url to variables from a markdown string like [title](url) Be concise, but include as much code as needed. Do not write anything else. Ever.


**Response:**
To parse the title and URL from a markdown string like [title](url) and assign them to variables in a bash terminal, you can use the following command:

```bash
markdown="[title](url)"
title=$(echo "$markdown" | sed -n 's/.*\[\([^]]*\)\].*/\1/p')
url=$(echo "$markdown" | sed -n 's/.*(\([^)]*\)).*/\1/p')
```

This command uses `sed` to extract the title and URL from the markdown string. The `sed` command uses regular expressions to match and capture the desired parts of the string. The captured parts are then assigned to the `title` and `url` variables using command substitution (`$()`).

Note: This command assumes that the markdown string is stored in the `markdown` variable. You can replace the value of `markdown` with your actual markdown string.
