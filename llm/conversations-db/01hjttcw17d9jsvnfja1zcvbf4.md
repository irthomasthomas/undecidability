Write a bash terminal command to PARSE title and url to variables from a markdown string like [title](url) Be concise, but include as much code as needed. Do not write anything else. Ever.


**Response:**
To parse the title and URL from a markdown string like [title](url) and assign them to variables, you can use the following bash terminal command:

```bash
markdown="[title](url)"
title=$(echo "$markdown" | sed -n 's/.*\[\([^]]*\)\].*/\1/p')
url=$(echo "$markdown" | sed -n 's/.*(\([^)]*\)).*/\1/p')
```

This command will assign the extracted title to the variable `title` and the extracted URL to the variable `url`. You can replace the `markdown` variable with your actual markdown string.
