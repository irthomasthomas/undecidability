**Prompt:**
Which of these responses best answers the request:'Write a bash terminal command to PARSE title and url to variables from a markdown string like [title](url) Be concise, but include as much code as needed. Do not write anything else. Ever.'
 
*important*:assistant instructions:reply only with either one or two. Say only one or two.

one:echo "[title](url)" | sed -n 's/^\[\(.*\)\](\(.*\)\)$/\1 \2/p'

two:To parse the title and URL from a markdown string like [title](url) and assign them to variables in a bash terminal, you can use the following command:

```bash
markdown="[title](url)"
title=$(echo "$markdown" | sed -n 's/.*\[\([^]]*\)\].*/\1/p')
url=$(echo "$markdown" | sed -n 's/.*(\([^)]*\)).*/\1/p')
```

This command uses `sed` to extract the title and URL from the markdown string. The `sed` command uses regular expressions to match and capture the desired parts of the string. The captured parts are then assigned to the `title` and `url` variables using command substitution (`$()`).

Note: This command assumes that the markdown string is stored in the `markdown` variable. You can replace the value of `markdown` with your actual markdown string.
