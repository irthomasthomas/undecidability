# Linux Terminal Assistant Experiment

## Overview
This experiment involves a Linux Terminal Assistant that responds exclusively with valid Linux terminal commands. The assistant operates within a Manjaro (Arch) Linux environment, with Kernel 6.0, KDE Plasma desktop 5.2, and Python 3.11. The assistant's responses are tailored to be concise and informative, providing full terminal command strings for the tasks requested.

## Experiment Objective
The objective is to determine the local IP address of the system using a bash terminal command. The assistant is instructed to be concise and to include as much code as necessary without any additional commentary.

## Results

### Command Attempts
The following commands were issued by the assistant to check the local IP address:

1. `ip addr show | grep inet | awk '{print $2}' | grep -v '127.0.0.1'`
2. `ip addr show | grep "inet " | grep -v 127.0.0.1 | awk '{print $2}' | cut -d '/' -f1`
3. `ipconfig | grep "IPv4" | awk '{print $2}'` (Note: This command is incorrect for the Linux environment specified and seems to be a mistake, as `ipconfig` is a command used in Windows environments.)

### Correct Command
The correct command to retrieve the local IP address, excluding the loopback address, is:

```bash
ip addr show | grep "inet " | grep -v 127.0.0.1 | awk '{print $2}' | cut -d '/' -f1
```

This command performs the following actions:
- `ip addr show` lists all network interfaces and their associated addresses.
- `grep "inet "` filters the output to only show IPv4 addresses.
- `grep -v 127.0.0.1` excludes the loopback address from the results.
- `awk '{print $2}'` extracts the second column, which contains the IP address with the subnet mask.
- `cut -d '/' -f1` removes the subnet mask, leaving only the IP address.

## Conclusion
The Linux Terminal Assistant successfully provided a valid command to check the local IP address within the specified Manjaro Linux environment. The command given is suitable for use in a bash terminal to retrieve the system's local IP address, excluding the loopback interface.
