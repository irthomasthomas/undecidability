**Response:**
# Issue: Variability in Output Based on Sentence Ordering in Prompts

## Description

During an experiment with the language model, it was observed that changing the order of sentences within a prompt can lead to different outcomes in the generated output. The experiment involved using the same text but ordered differently to instruct the model to provide a Linux terminal command for checking the local IP address.

## Experiment Details

The model was prompted multiple times with variations in the sentence order. The core instructions remained the same, emphasizing the following points:

- The model is a Linux terminal assistant.
- It should always respond with valid Linux terminal commands.
- The system specifics were provided (Manjaro Linux, Kernel 6.0, KDE Plasma 5.2, Python 3.11).
- The model was instructed to be concise, include much information, and use the latest info up to its knowledge cutoff.
- The model was asked to provide a bash terminal command to check the local IP address and instructed not to write anything else.

## Results

The results of the experiment showed that the model consistently provided valid commands for checking the local IP address. However, there was a slight variation in the command structure based on the prompt order. Here are the different outputs observed:

1. `ip addr show | grep inet | awk '{print $2}' | grep -v '127.0.0.1'`
2. `ip addr show | grep "inet " | grep -v 127.0.0.1 | awk '{print $2}' | cut -d '/' -f1`
3. `ipconfig | grep "IPv4" | awk '{print $2}'` (Note: `ipconfig` is not a standard Linux command and is typically used in Windows environments, indicating an error in the output.)

## Conclusion

The experiment demonstrates that while the model is capable of understanding and responding to the prompt with relevant Linux commands, the specific structure of the command can vary slightly with changes in the sentence order of the prompt. It is important to note that all commands provided, except for the one involving `ipconfig`, are valid and would achieve the desired outcome on a Linux system.

The consistency in providing valid commands suggests that the model has a robust understanding of the task. However, the inclusion of an incorrect command (`ipconfig`) in one instance indicates that the model's output can be influenced by the structure of the prompt, and care should be taken when crafting prompts to ensure accuracy.
