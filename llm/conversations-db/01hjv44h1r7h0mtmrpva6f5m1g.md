# Prompt Ordering Experiment: Impact on Linux Terminal Command Outputs

## Overview

This experiment investigates how the ordering of sentences in a prompt affects the output quality when interacting with a language model designed to generate Linux terminal commands. The model is instructed to respond with valid commands for a Manjaro (Arch) Linux system, considering the latest information up to the knowledge cutoff in 2023.

## Methodology

The same text was provided to the language model in different orders to observe the variation in the generated outputs. The primary task was to write a bash terminal command to check the local IP address. The prompts were structured with varying sequences, placing the task description and system context in different positions.

## Results

The following prompt-response pairs were generated during the experiment:

### Prompt 1

```
"You are a linux terminal assistant. Always respond in valid Linux terminal commands. The system is Manjaro (Arch) Linux, Kernel 6.0, KDE Plasma desktop 5.2, Python 3.11 Think it through carefully. Be concise, but include much info. Reply with the full terminal cmd string. In problem solving, always use latest info up to your knowledge cutoff.
Write a bash terminal command to check my local ip Be concise, but include as much code as needed. Do not write anything else. Ever."
```

#### Response 1

```bash
ip addr show | grep inet | awk '{print $2}' | grep -v '127.0.0.1'
```

### Prompt 2

```
"Write a bash terminal command to check my local ip Be concise, but include as much code as needed. Do not write anything else. Ever."
```

#### Response 2

```bash
ipconfig | grep "IPv4" | awk '{print $2}'
```

### Prompt 3

```
"Write a bash terminal command to check my local ip Be concise, but include as much code as needed. Do not write anything else. Ever.

You are a linux terminal assistant. Always respond in valid Linux terminal commands. The system is Manjaro (Arch) Linux, Kernel 6.0, KDE Plasma desktop 5.2, Python 3.11 Think it through carefully. Be concise, but include much info. Reply with the full terminal cmd string. In problem solving, always use latest info up to your knowledge cutoff.
"
```

#### Response 3

```bash
ip addr show | grep "inet " | grep -v 127.0.0.1 | awk '{print $2}' | cut -d '/' -f1
```

## Analysis

The experiment demonstrates that the ordering of sentences within the prompt can lead to different outcomes. Notably, Response 2 contains an incorrect command (`ipconfig`) for the specified Linux system, which suggests that the model may have been influenced by the lack of immediate context regarding the operating system.

In contrast, when the system context was provided before the task description (Prompts 1 and 3), the model consistently generated appropriate commands for a Linux environment. This indicates that the model's performance can be sensitive to the structure of the prompt, and that providing context upfront can lead to more accurate responses.

## Conclusion

The ordering of information in a prompt can significantly affect the quality of the output from a language model. For tasks requiring specific contextual knowledge, such as generating Linux terminal commands, it is beneficial to provide the relevant context before the task description to guide the model towards the correct domain and improve the accuracy of its responses.

## Recommendations

- When interacting with language models for technical tasks, structure prompts with context first to ensure domain-appropriate responses.
- Further experiments could explore the impact of prompt ordering on different types of tasks and domains to generalize these findings.
