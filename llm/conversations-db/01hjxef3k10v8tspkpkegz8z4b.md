**Prompt:**
How do I send a link from firefox to another linux app?

**Response:**
To send a link from Firefox to another Linux app, you can use the "xdg-open" command. Here's how you can do it:

1. Copy the URL of the webpage you want to send.
2. Open a terminal window.
3. Type "xdg-open " (without quotes) in the terminal, followed by a space.
4. Paste the URL after the space.
5. Press Enter.

This will open the URL in the default application associated with that URL type. For example, if it's a web link, it will open in your default web browser. If it's a file link, it will open in the default file manager.

Note: The "xdg-open" command is a cross-desktop command that works on most Linux distributions. If it's not available on your system, you can try using "gnome-open" for GNOME-based desktop environments or "kde-open" for KDE-based desktop environments.

**Prompt:**
write a shell script I can use to automatically open a link from firefox to nyxt browser.

**Response:**
Certainly! Here's a shell script that you can use to automatically open a link from Firefox to Nyxt browser:

```shell
#!/bin/bash

# Get the URL from the command line argument
URL="$1"

# Set the command to open the URL in Nyxt browser
NYXT_COMMAND="nyxt --new-window $URL"

# Execute the command
$NYXT_COMMAND
```

Save the script to a file, for example, `open_with_nyxt.sh`. Make sure to give the file executable permissions using the `chmod` command:

```shell
chmod +x open_with_nyxt.sh
```

Now, you can run the script by specifying the link you want to open from Firefox as a command-line argument:

```shell
./open_with_nyxt.sh <URL>
```

Replace `<URL>` with the actual URL you want to open. This script will open Nyxt browser in a new window and load the specified URL.

**Prompt:**
I think you can improve on that. How do I get the url out off firefox? Maybe you could send the key input to select the url and copy it

**Response:**
To extract the current URL from Firefox programmatically, it's common to leverage tools like `xdotool` to simulate keyboard input, focusing the address bar, and copying the URL to the clipboard. The `xclip` command can then be used to pipe the clipboard contents into Nyxt.

Install `xdotool` and `xclip` if you haven't already:

```shell
sudo apt-get install xdotool xclip
```

Then, the shell script to copy the current URL from Firefox and open it in Nyxt could look like this:

```shell
#!/bin/bash

# Identify the window containing Firefox
WID=$(xdotool search --onlyvisible --name "Mozilla Firefox" | head -1)

if [ -z "$WID" ]; then
    echo "Firefox window not found. Make sure Firefox is running."
    exit 1
fi

# Bring the window into focus
xdotool windowactivate --sync $WID

# Wait for the window to focus
sleep 0.1

# Press CTRL+L to select the address bar contents
xdotool key --window $WID ctrl+l

# Wait for a moment to ensure the keystroke was registered
sleep 0.1

# Press CTRL+C to copy the URL
xdotool key --window $WID ctrl+c

# Wait for clipboard to contain the URL
sleep 0.1

# Get URL from clipboard
URL=$(xclip -o -selection clipboard)

# Open URL in Nyxt browser in a new window
nyxt --new-window "$URL"
```

Make the script executable:

```shell
chmod +x open_with_nyxt.sh
```

And run the script:

```shell
./open_with_nyxt.sh
```

Be aware:
- The method is hacky, and not 100% reliable because of timing issues and changing titles.
- Ensure Firefox accessibility might be required in some settings.
- `xdotool` depends on being able to interact with the X11 server, and won't work in Wayland environments.
- If Firefox is not your front window, or in cases where you have multiple Firefox windows, you might need a more complex `xdotool` search command.
