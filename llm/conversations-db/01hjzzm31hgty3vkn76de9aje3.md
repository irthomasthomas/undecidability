**Prompt:**
Given this sqlitedb, how do I search for rows with a themes object that includes 'Process management'?

sqlite3 "logs.db"  "SELECT response_id, prompt, labels FROM labels;"                           1 ✘

  ]
}

**Response:**
To search for rows with a `themes` object that includes 'Process management' in a SQLite database, you can use the `json_extract` function to extract the `themes` JSON array and then use the `json_each` table-valued function to search within that array. However, SQLite's JSON support might be limited, and you may need to enable the JSON1 extension if it's not already included in your SQLite build.

Here's an example of how you can perform the search:

```sql
SELECT response_id, prompt, labels
FROM labels,
json_each(json_extract(labels, '$.themes')) AS themes
WHERE themes.value = 'Process management';
```

This query does the following:

1. Extracts the `themes` JSON array from the `labels` column using `json_extract`.
2. Uses `json_each` to create a virtual table where each entry in the `themes` array is a separate row.
3. Filters the results where the `value` column (which represents each item in the `themes` array) is equal to 'Process management'.

Please note that this query assumes that the JSON structure is consistent and that the `themes` key always contains an array. If the structure can vary, you may need to add additional checks or use a different approach.

If you encounter any issues with JSON functions, make sure that your SQLite version supports JSON1 extension and that it's enabled. If it's not enabled, you might need to compile SQLite with the JSON1 extension or use a precompiled binary that includes it.
