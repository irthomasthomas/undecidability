**Prompt:**
Given this sqlitedb, how do I search for rows with a themes object that includes 'Process management'?

sqlite3 "logs.db"  "SELECT response_id, prompt, labels FROM labels;"                           1 ✘

  ]
}

**Response:**
To search for rows with a `themes` object that includes 'Process management' within a JSON column in SQLite, you can use the `json_each` table-valued function provided by SQLite's JSON1 extension. This function allows you to iterate over each element in a JSON array.

Here's an example of how you can write the SQL query to find rows where the `themes` JSON array includes 'Process management':

```sql
SELECT response_id, prompt, labels
FROM labels,
json_each(labels, '$.themes') as themes
WHERE themes.value = 'Process management';
```

In this query, `labels` is the name of the table and also the name of the column that contains the JSON data. The `json_each` function takes two arguments: the JSON column and the path to the JSON array within that column. In this case, `$.themes` specifies the `themes` array at the root of the JSON object.

The `WHERE` clause filters the results to only include rows where one of the elements in the `themes` array is 'Process management'.

Please make sure that your SQLite version supports the JSON1 extension, as this functionality relies on it. If the JSON1 extension is not enabled, you may need to enable it or update your SQLite version.

You can run this query directly from the command line like this:

```sh
sqlite3 "logs.db" "SELECT response_id, prompt, labels FROM labels, json_each(labels, '$.themes') as themes WHERE themes.value = 'Process management';"
```

This should return all rows from the `labels` table where the `themes` array in the `labels` JSON column includes the value 'Process management'.
