**Prompt:**
Given this sqlitedb, how do I search using bash for rows with a themes object that includes 'Process management'? Think carefully before writing the solution.

sqlite3 "logs.db"  "SELECT response_id, prompt, labels FROM labels;"                           1 ✘ 
01h57bc98atz3dx34xcfb84vsz|what information is available for a given PID on linux?|{
  "themes": [
    "Process information",
    "System monitoring",
    "Resource utilization",
    "Process management",
    "PID-based operations",
    "Process status",
    "Process control"
  ]
}

**Response:**
To search for rows with a `themes` object that includes 'Process management', you can use the `json_extract` function provided by SQLite to extract the `themes` JSON array and then use the `json_each` table-valued function to search within that array. Here's how you can do it using a bash command:

```bash
sqlite3 "logs.db" "SELECT response_id, prompt, labels FROM labels, json_each(json_extract(labels, '\$.themes')) WHERE json_each.value = 'Process management';"
```

This command will:

1. Open the `logs.db` SQLite database.
2. Use the `SELECT` statement to retrieve the `response_id`, `prompt`, and `labels` columns from the `labels` table.
3. Use the `json_extract` function to extract the `themes` array from the `labels` JSON column.
4. Use the `json_each` table-valued function to iterate over each element in the `themes` array.
5. Use the `WHERE` clause to filter rows where one of the elements in the `themes` array is exactly 'Process management'.

Please note that the JSON functions (`json_extract`, `json_each`) are available in SQLite version 3.9.0 (2015-10-14) and later. If you're using an older version of SQLite, you'll need to upgrade to use these functions.
