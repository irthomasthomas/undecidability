**Prompt:**
How can I print to console from bash and python without it being returned as a value to the caller?

**Response:**
In Bash, you can print to the console using the `echo` command. By default, the output will be displayed on the console and not returned as a value to the caller.

In Python, you can use the `print` function to print to the console. By default, `print` outputs to the console and does not return a value to the caller.

If you want to suppress the output from being displayed on the console, you can redirect it to the null device (`/dev/null`) in both Bash and Python. This effectively discards the output.

In Bash, you can redirect the output to `/dev/null` using the following syntax:
```
command > /dev/null
```

In Python, you can redirect the output to `/dev/null` by using the `print` function with the `file` parameter set to `sys.stdout`:
```python
import sys
print('output', file=sys.stdout)
```

Both of these methods will prevent the output from being returned as a value to the caller.
