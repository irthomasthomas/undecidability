**Prompt:**
How can I print to console from bash and python without it being returned as a value to the caller?

**Response:**
In Bash, use `echo` or `printf` to print to the console without returning the value to the caller. For example:

```bash
echo "This will print to console"
```

In Python, use the `print()` function to output to the console without returning the value to the caller:

```python
print("This will print to console")
```

Both `echo` in Bash and `print()` in Python write to the standard output stream (`stdout`), which is typically the console, and do not affect the return value of the script or function. The return value in Bash is set by the `exit` command or the status of the last command executed, and in Python by the `return` statement in a function.
