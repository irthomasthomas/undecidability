**Prompt:**
How can I print to console from bash and python without it being captured by the caller?

**Response:**
In Bash, to print to the console without it being captured by the caller, you can redirect the output to `/dev/tty`:

```bash
echo "Message to console" > /dev/tty
```

In Python, you can achieve the same by writing directly to `/dev/tty`:

```python
with open('/dev/tty', 'w') as tty:
    tty.write("Message to console\n")
```

This bypasses any redirection or piping that the caller might have set up.
