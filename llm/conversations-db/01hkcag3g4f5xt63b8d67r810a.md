**Prompt:**
Write a bash terminal command to achieve the following task.
Be concise, but include as much code as needed. Do not write anything else. Ever.

**TASK**
**sync my git fork with master branch


**Response:**
To sync your git fork with the master branch, you can use the following bash terminal command:

```bash
git fetch upstream
git checkout master
git merge upstream/master
git push origin master
```

This command assumes that you have already added the upstream remote repository to your local git configuration. If you haven't done so, you can add it using the following command:

```bash
git remote add upstream <upstream_repository_url>
```

Replace `<upstream_repository_url>` with the URL of the upstream repository you want to sync with.
