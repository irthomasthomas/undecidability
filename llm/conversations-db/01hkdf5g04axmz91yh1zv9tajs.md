**Prompt:**
Write a bash terminal command to achieve the following task.
Be concise, but include as much code as needed. Do not write anything else. Ever.

**TASK**
**call a function multiple times in parallel


**Response:**
To call a function multiple times in parallel, you can use the `&` operator in bash to run the function in the background. Here's an example:

```bash
function_name &
function_name &
function_name &
```

Replace `function_name` with the actual name of the function you want to call. You can repeat the line with `&` as many times as you want to call the function in parallel.
