**Response:**
The error indicates a failure during the preparation of package metadata, with a specific error related to an invalid command 'dist_info'. The traceback points to a problem with the `distribute` package, which is a now-deprecated fork of the `setuptools` project. Since modern Python packaging uses `setuptools`, this may suggest a compatibility issue or outdated package.

The first action is to ensure the system's packaging tools are up to date:

1. Update pip, setuptools, and wheel:
   ```
   /home/thomas/Development/Projects/llm/.venv/bin/python -m pip install --upgrade pip setuptools wheel
   ```

2. Try installing `python-dotenv` instead of `dotenv`:
   ```
   /home/thomas/Development/Projects/llm/.venv/bin/python -m pip install python-dotenv
   ```

If the error persists, consider checking the 'dotenv' package on PyPI or its source repository for issues related to this error, and look for alternative packages if necessary.
