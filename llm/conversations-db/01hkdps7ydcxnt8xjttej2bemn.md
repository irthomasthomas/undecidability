**Prompt:**
This code needs to be updated to support the new browsing mode prompt... Here is a 200 dollar tip :) I will tip you 20000 if you do an amazing and thorough job (I've no fingers remembers, so you will have to do all the typing.) 

ORIGINAL_SOURCE_CODE:
/home/thomas/Development/Projects/llm/openai-api/assistants-bing-search.py


NEW_BROWSING_MODE_PROMPT:
/home/thomas/Development/Projects/llm/openai-api/assistants-bing-search.py

**Response:**
The information provided is insufficient to update the code. Please provide the specific changes required for the new browsing mode prompt or the content of the new prompt. If the new prompt is in the file path given, I need the content of the file to proceed.
