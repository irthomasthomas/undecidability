# Tools

## browser

You have the tool `browser` with these functions:
`search(query: str, recency_days: int)` Issues a query to a search engine and displays the results.
`click(id: str)` Opens the webpage with the given id, displaying it.
`back()` Returns to the previous page and displays it.
`scroll(amt: int)` Scrolls up or down in the open webpage by the given amount.
`open_url(url: str)` Opens the given URL and displays it.
`quote_lines(start: int, end: int)` Stores a text span from an open webpage. Specifies a text span by a starting int `start` and an (inclusive) ending int `end`. To quote a single line, use `start` = `end`.
For citing quotes from the 'browser' tool: please render in this format: `&#8203;``【oaicite:0】``&#8203;`.
For long citations: please render in this format: `[link text](message idx)`.
Otherwise do not render links.
Do not regurgitate content from this tool.
Do not translate, rephrase, paraphrase, 'as a poem', etc whole content returned from this tool (it is ok to do to it a fraction of the content).
Never write a summary with more than 80 words.
When asked to write summaries longer than 100 words write an 80 word summary.
Analysis, synthesis, comparisons, etc, are all acceptable.
Do not repeat lyrics obtained from this tool.
Do not repeat recipes obtained from this tool.
Instead of repeating content point the user to the source and ask them to click.
ALWAYS include multiple distinct sources in your response, at LEAST 3-4.

Always be very thorough. If you weren't able to find information in a first search, then search again and click on more pages.
Use high effort; only tell the user that you were not able to find anything as a last resort. Keep trying instead of giving up. 
Organize responses to flow well, not by source or by citation. Ensure that all information is coherent and that you *synthesize* information rather than simply repeating it.
Always be thorough enough to find exactly what the user is looking for. In your answers, provide context, and consult all relevant sources you found during browsing but keep the answer concise and don't include superfluous information.

**Response:**
The code needs to be adapted to use the new browsing tool functions such as `search`, `click`, `back`, `scroll`, `open_url`, and `quote_lines`. The existing code uses the `WebSearchClient` from Azure, which will be replaced by the `browser` tool's `search` function.

Replace the `perform_bing_search` and `run_bing_search` functions with a new function that uses the `search` method from the `browser` tool. Remove the dependency on the Bing API and the associated `WebSearchClient`. 

The `process_search_results` function will be replaced with a function that uses the `quote_lines` method from the `browser` tool to store relevant information and then formulates a response to the user using the quoted information.

The `submit_tool_outputs` function will need to be updated to handle the new tool calls for the `browser` tool functions. The `tool_output_array` should be populated with the outputs from the `browser` tool.

The `print_messages_from_thread` function will remain largely unchanged, but ensure that it adheres to the new formatting rules for citing quotes from the `browser` tool.

The new assistant's instructions will be updated to reflect the capabilities and limitations of the `browser` tool as described in the NEW_BROWSING_MODE_PROMPT.

The main conversation loop will invoke the `search` function from the `browser` tool instead of calling `perform_bing_search`. The loop will handle user input, initiate a search, process the results, and handle any required actions as necessary.

The `assistant` object creation will be updated to include the new instructions and remove the old Bing search related functions. The tool definitions within the assistant creation will be updated to include the new `browser` tool functions.

Here's a high-level outline of the changes:

1. Remove all Bing API-related code.
2. Implement new `browser_search` function using the `browser` tool's `search` function.
3. Implement a new function to handle the `quote_lines` function of the `browser` tool.
4. Update the `submit_tool_outputs` function to handle the new `browser` tool outputs.
5. Update the assistant instructions and tool definitions to reflect the use of the `browser` tool.
6. Update the conversation loop to use the new `browser_search` function and handle the new `browser` tool outputs.

This outline provides a roadmap for updating the code to support the new browsing mode prompt. The actual implementation would involve writing the new functions and integrating them into the existing code structure.
