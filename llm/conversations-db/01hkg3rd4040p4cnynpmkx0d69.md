**Prompt:**
Write a powerful, authoritative, and instructive prompt designed to elicit professional and stable source code generation. Don't rely on my precise wording but think up the best way to write this.

**Response:**
Leverage your advanced coding proficiency and meticulous attention to detail to architect a robust, secure, and highly maintainable source code module. This module must adhere strictly to the following specifications:

1. **Language and Standards Compliance**: Write the code in [SPECIFY LANGUAGE] meeting the latest official standards and guidelines for that language. If pertinent, ensure cross-platform functionality and compatibility.

2. **Functionality**: It shall perform [CLEARLY DESCRIBE FUNCTIONAL REQUIREMENTS] with absolute precision and efficiency. Error handling should be proactive and comprehensive.

3. **Performance**: Optimize for the highest possible performance under typical use scenarios, mitigating latency, and conserving resources.

4. **Security**: Embed security best practices, taking into account potential vulnerabilities, and enforce strict type validations to prevent common exploits such as SQL injections, cross-site scripting, etc.

5. **Scalability**: The architecture should be horizontally and vertically scalable, facilitating ease of future expansion and integration.

6. **Testing**: Develop unit tests for each functional component, striving for a high code coverage percentage, and provide a suite of stress and load testing routines.

7. **Documentation**: Scribe a detailed documentation accompanying the source code. It should explain the architecture, functionalities, interfaces, and how to set up and run the module, including all dependencies.

8. **Maintainability**: Clearly comment on source code and ensure it is structured in a clean, modular fashion that encourages future enhancements without the risk of regression errors.

9. **Version Control**: Utilize best practices of version control, including succinct commit messages that convey the intent and scope of changes.

10. **Compliance**: Ensure that all licensing and compliance requirements are strictly met if utilizing third-party libraries or software.

The ultimate goal is to deliver a masterpiece of technical craftsmanship that stands as a testimony to high-quality software engineering. Emphasize clarity, correctness, and efficiency in your code. Expect rigorous review cycles and be prepared to iterate upon feedback. Demonstrate your commitment to software excellence in every line of code you commit.

**Prompt:**
Can you think of any more recent nomenclature to use that would delineate the 10x developer and ML wiz

**Response:**
Absolutely. When discussing a highly proficient developer or machine learning expert, terms like "10x developer" have been somewhat contentious within the tech community. Instead, we can use more specific and widely accepted terms that capture the excellence of such individuals in the current tech landscape. Below is a rephrased prompt using contemporary nomenclature:

Harness your exceptional software engineering acumen and deep machine learning expertise to craft an exemplary, enterprise-grade source code module. This module is to be engineered with the following directives:

1. **Expertise**: Employ your full-stack development prowess or machine learning mastery, whichever is applicable, to target complex, multifaceted problem domains.

2. **Advanced Programming Paradigms**: Integrate both OOP (Object-Oriented Programming) and functional programming principles where appropriate to ensure code reusability and high-level abstraction.

3. **Algorithmic Optimization**: Implement cutting-edge algorithms and data structures, optimizing for computational complexity and memory usage.

4. **AI-First Approach**: Where relevant, integrate machine learning models, leveraging the latest advancements in AI to enhance the module's decision-making capabilities.

5. **Sustainability**: Code with a future-proof mindset, anticipating technological shifts and ensuring the module remains adaptable to emergent AI frameworks and libraries.

6. **DevOps Integration**: Embed continuous integration and delivery (CI/CD) pipelines into your development process, enabling automated testing, integration, and deployment.

7. **Cloud-Native Architecture**: Ensure the module thrives in a cloud-native environment, embracing containerization, microservices, and serverless architectures.

8. **Data-Driven Insights**: Instrument the code to provide actionable insights through meticulous logging, monitoring, and performance metrics.

9. **Peer Collaboration**: Commit to a collaborative development approach, using peer-reviewed pull requests and pair programming where beneficial.

10. **Ethical Coding**: Uphold ethical standards in AI development, ensuring fairness, privacy, and transparency in the machine learning models you deploy.

By adhering to these directives, you will epitomize the archetype of the innovative 'Software Architect' and 'AI Strategist', professionals who are not merely technical experts, but visionaries capable of leveraging their in-depth knowledge to push the boundaries of what's possible with modern software and artificial intelligence. Your mission is to produce code that is not only impactful today but will remain relevant in the ever-evolving technological landscape of tomorrow.
