**Prompt:**
What does untracked mean in git?

**Response:**
In Git, the term "untracked" refers to files in your working directory that were not present in the last snapshot of your project (i.e., the last commit); they are not in the staging area, and Git has not been told to include them in version control. This means that Git isn't keeping a history of changes for these files, and they will not be included in your next commit unless you explicitly tell Git to do so.

You can make Git start tracking these untracked files by using the `git add` command, which adds them to the staging area and prepares them to be included in the next commit.

Here's an example to clarify:

1. You have a Git repository set up.
2. You create a new file called `example.txt` inside your repository's working directory.
3. The file `example.txt` is untracked because Git has not been informed about itâ€”there is no record of it in Git's index or previous commits.
4. If you want Git to track `example.txt`, you would run `git add example.txt`. This moves the file to the staging area.
5. Once staged, you can commit the changes, and `example.txt` will become a tracked file, with its changes being monitored by Git from this point forward.
