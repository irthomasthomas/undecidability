**Prompt:**
What does untracked mean in git?

**Response:**
In Git, "untracked" refers to files in your working directory that were not present in the last snapshot taken during the previous commit, and they are also not included in the staging area. This typically happens when you add new files to a directory that is part of a Git repository, but have not yet added them to Git's tracking with the `git add` command.

Untracked files are essentially unknown to Git until you explicitly tell it to include them in the version control system. Once you use `git add` on an untracked file, Git starts tracking it and it becomes a "tracked file". At this point, the file will be included in the staging area, ready to be committed to the repository.

You can see which files are untracked in your repository by running the `git status` command. The output will categorize the files in your working directory into different sections such as "Changes to be committed", "Changes not staged for commit", and "Untracked files". Untracked files will be listed under the "Untracked files" section.

If you decide you do not want certain untracked files to be included in your repository, or you do not want them to show up every time you run `git status`, you can add these files or patterns to the `.gitignore` file. Files mentioned in `.gitignore` are ignored by Git, meaning changes to them will not be tracked and they will not show up as untracked in `git status` outputs.
