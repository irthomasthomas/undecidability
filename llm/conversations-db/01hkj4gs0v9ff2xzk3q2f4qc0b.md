**Prompt:**
in python, request 100 labels from the gh repo: irthomasthomas/undecidability

**Response:**
To make an HTTP request in Python and retrieve 100 labels from the GitHub repository "irthomasthomas/undecidability", you can use the `requests` library. Here's an example code to accomplish that:

```python
import requests

url = 'https://api.github.com/repos/irthomasthomas/undecidability/labels'
params = {'per_page': 100}
headers = {'Accept': 'application/vnd.github.v3+json'}

response = requests.get(url, params=params, headers=headers)
labels = response.json()

for label in labels:
    print(label['name'])
```

In this code, we send a GET request to the GitHub API endpoint `/repos/irthomasthomas/undecidability/labels`. We pass the `per_page` parameter as `100` to retrieve 100 labels per page (the maximum allowed). We also set the `Accept` header to `application/vnd.github.v3+json` to indicate that we want to receive the JSON response.

The response is stored in the `labels` variable as a list of dictionaries. You can then iterate over the list and access the desired information from each label. In this example, we print the name of each label.

Make sure to have the `requests` library installed in your Python environment (`pip install requests`) before running this code.
