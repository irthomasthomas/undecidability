**Prompt:**
in python, request 100 labels from the gh repo: irthomasthomas/undecidability

**Response:**
To request 100 labels from the GitHub repository `irthomasthomas/undecidability` using the GitHub CLI (`gh`) in a Python script, you can use the `subprocess` module to execute the `gh api` command. Below is a Python code snippet demonstrating how to achieve this:

```python
import subprocess
import json

# Set up the command to fetch 100 labels from the specified repository
command = [
    "gh", "--paginate", "api", "repos/irthomasthomas/undecidability/labels?per_page=100"
]

# Execute the command using subprocess
result = subprocess.run(command, capture_output=True, text=True, check=True)

# Parse the JSON output into a Python data structure
labels = json.loads(result.stdout)

# Print the information or do further processing if needed
for label in labels:
    print(f"Label Name: {label['name']}, Color: {label['color']}")

# If an error occurs, print the error message
if result.stderr:
    print("Error:", result.stderr)
```

This script uses the `subprocess.run()` function to execute the `gh api` command and fetch up to 100 labels from the repository. It then parses the JSON response into a Python list and iterates through it to print out the label names and their colors.

Make sure that you have the `gh` CLI installed on your system and that you are authenticated with GitHub. If not, you can install it and authenticate using:

```bash
brew install gh # For macOS with Homebrew, or find specific instructions for your system
gh auth login   # Follow the prompts to authenticate
```

The `--paginate` flag helps fetch all labels if they exceed one page of results.

Please note that the number of labels returned by GitHub API may be subject to rate limits or pagination. The script above does not handle pagination beyond the `--paginate` option provided by `gh`. If you need to handle more complex pagination or ensure to get exactly 100 labels where there are more than one hundred, you should write additional code to manage this.

**Prompt:**
is that authenticated? Needs be authed

**Response:**
Yes, the given Python snippet, which uses the `gh` CLI, must run in an environment where the `gh` CLI is already authenticated with GitHub. The `gh` CLI handles authentication normally outside of your script, so you don't need to pass any authentication tokens within the script itself.

To authenticate with GitHub using the `gh` CLI, you should run the following command in your terminal before running the Python script:

```bash
gh auth login
```

Follow the prompts to log in by either generating a personal access token or using the web browser login flow. Once authenticated, `gh` stores the credentials, and all subsequent `gh` commands (including those executed within your Python script) will use this authenticated session.

If you prefer to use the GitHub API directly without the `gh` CLI and handle authentication within your Python code, you could use the `requests` library along with a personal access token like this:

```python
import requests
import json

# Your GitHub personal access token
token = 'your_personal_access_token'

headers = {
    'Authorization': f'token {token}',
    'Accept': 'application/vnd.github.v3+json',
}

# GitHub API endpoint for fetching labels
url = 'https://api.github.com/repos/irthomasthomas/undecidability/labels?per_page=100'

# Make the GET request to the GitHub API
response = requests.get(url, headers=headers)

# Check if the request was successful
if response.status_code == 200:
    # Parse the response JSON into a Python list
    labels = response.json()
    # Print label names and colors
    for label in labels:
        print(f"Label Name: {label['name']}, Color: {label['color']}")
else:
    # Print the error message if the request failed
    print(f"Failed to fetch labels: {response.status_code}")
```

Before running this script, replace `'your_personal_access_token'` with your actual GitHub personal access token. You can generate a new personal access token by visiting [GitHub's Token Settings](https://github.com/settings/tokens). Ensure that the token has the necessary scopes to access repository information.
