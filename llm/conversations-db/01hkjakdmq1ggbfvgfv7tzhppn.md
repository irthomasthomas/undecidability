Fix the broken recursion \n *IMPORTANT* Write out the full source code yourself.
            user_query = f"What gh issue labels should I assign to this bookmark?
url: {url}
title: {title}
description: {description}
gh_repo: {repo}
"

**Response:**
It seems like you're asking for a function that would recursively generate a query for GitHub issue labels based on a bookmark's URL, title, description, and GitHub repository. However, recursion doesn't seem to be necessary or appropriate for this task, as it's a simple string formatting operation that doesn't require repeated function calls.

Instead, I'll provide you with a simple Python function that formats the user query as you described:

```python
def create_gh_issue_query(url, title, description, repo):
    user_query = f"""What gh issue labels should I assign to this bookmark?
url: {url}
title: {title}
description: {description}
gh_repo: {repo}
"""
    return user_query

# Example usage:
url = "https://example.com/bookmark"
title = "Example Bookmark Title"
description = "This is a description of the example bookmark."
repo = "username/repository"

query = create_gh_issue_query(url, title, description, repo)
print(query)
```

When you run the above code with the provided example data, it will generate the following output:

```
What gh issue labels should I assign to this bookmark?
url: https://example.com/bookmark
title: Example Bookmark Title
description: This is a description of the example bookmark.
gh_repo: username/repository
```

This function simply takes the given parameters and formats them into a string that matches the specified template. There's no need for recursion in this case. If you had a more complex scenario where you need to process nested data structures or perform repeated operations until a condition is met, then recursion would be a topic to explore.
