**Prompt:**
Simplify this by removing the get_issues_labels_list code and simply provide the labels every time. *IMPORTANT* Do not write any incomplete code. Rewrite the entire new sourcecode. Important: Do not change my variable names. Keep the same tool calling format.

**Response:**
Your request is not entirely clear as I do not have access to the existing code in the specified file or more detailed requirements about how the labels should be provided. However, based on the information given, I'll provide you with a hypothetical simplified Python script that assumes `tool` is an instance of a class responsible for creating labels.

Please note that since accessing `/home/thomas/Development/Projects/llm/ai-issues/llm_label_maker/label_maker_gpt4t.py` is not possible, I am creating a new hypothetical source code instance assuming the removal of `get_issues_labels_list` function and providing the labels directly to the `tool` call while keeping your variable names intact.

```python
class Tool:
    def __init__(self):
        # Some initialization as required
        pass

    def create_labels(self, labels):
        # Implementation for creating labels
        print("Labels created:", labels)

# Instance of the Tool class
tool = Tool()

# Hypothetical labels list provided directly
issue_labels = ['bug', 'feature request', 'documentation']

# Use the tool to create labels without get_issues_labels_list
if __name__ == "__main__":
    # Tool now takes labels directly without calling get_issues_labels_list
    tool.create_labels(issue_labels)
```

In this sample code:

- I assumed that `Tool` is a class with a `create_labels` method which is used to handle the labeling.
- The `issue_labels` variable is defined with the labels you want to provide directly to the `tool`.
- We call `tool.create_labels(issue_labels)` directly without the need to define a `get_issues_labels_list` function.

You will need to replace this example with the actual logic of how your `tool` creates or handles labels based on the original code from `llm_label_maker/label_maker_gpt4t.py`.
