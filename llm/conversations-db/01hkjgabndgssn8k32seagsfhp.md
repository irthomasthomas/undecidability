This refactored code attempts to address many potential issues, considers best practices, and provides comments that highlight areas for improvement. Note that without comprehensive knowledge of the intended behavior and the broader system context, some refactorings may not be accurate or could alter the intended functionality. It's imperative to ensure the logic still aligns with business needs and any integration points.
