**Prompt:**
How to prevent the output of python print statement being captured by the calling bash script?

**Response:**
Redirect the Python script's standard output to `/dev/tty` to ensure it goes to the terminal and not to the calling Bash script's capturing mechanism.

In Python:
```python
import sys
sys.stdout = open('/dev/tty', 'w')
print("This will go to the terminal.")
```

In Bash, when calling the Python script:
```bash
python script.py # Output will appear in the terminal, not captured by the script
```

If the Bash script attempts to capture the output using command substitution or pipes, the redirected output in the Python script will still go to the terminal.
