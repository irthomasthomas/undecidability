**Prompt:**
Add video to gh readme

**Response:**
To add a video to a GitHub README.md file, you need to host the video file somewhere accessible over the internet and then embed it using Markdown or HTML. GitHub does not host video files directly in repositories for use in READMEs.

Here's how to embed a video using Markdown:

```markdown
![Alt text for screen readers](URL-to-video)
```

Replace `URL-to-video` with the direct link to your video. This will not embed a playable video but will link to the video instead.

For an embedded playable video, you'll need to use HTML:

```html
<video width="320" height="240" controls>
  <source src="URL-to-video" type="video/mp4">
  Your browser does not support the video tag.
</video>
```

Replace `URL-to-video` with the direct link to your video file. The `type` attribute should reflect the correct MIME type of your video.

If your video is hosted on a platform like YouTube, you can use an iframe to embed it:

```html
<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/VIDEO_ID" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>
```

Replace `VIDEO_ID` with the actual ID of your YouTube video.

Remember that embedding videos can make your README heavier to load, so consider linking to a video instead if it's not essential to be embedded directly.
