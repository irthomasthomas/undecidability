**Prompt:**
Write a bash terminal command to achieve the following task.
Be concise, but include as much code as needed. Do not write anything else. Ever.

**TASK**
**can you keep writing new lines to a linux pipe before it is read?


**Response:**
Yes, you can keep writing new lines to a Linux pipe before it is read. Here is an example of a bash terminal command that demonstrates this:

```bash
echo "Line 1" > my_pipe &
echo "Line 2" > my_pipe &
echo "Line 3" > my_pipe &
```

In this example, we are using the `echo` command to write three different lines to a pipe named `my_pipe`. The `&` at the end of each line allows the commands to run in the background, so you can continue writing new lines to the pipe without waiting for the previous lines to be read.

Please note that in order to read the contents of the pipe, you will need to use a separate command or script.
