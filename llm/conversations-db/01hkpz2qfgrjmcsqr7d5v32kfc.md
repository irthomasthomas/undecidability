**TASK**
**write additional new lines to a linux pipe before it is read


**Response:**
To write additional new lines to a Linux pipe before it is read, you can use the `echo` command to add new lines, and then use the `cat` command to read the contents of the pipe. Here is the bash terminal command to achieve this task:

```
echo -e "new line 1\nnew line 2" | cat
```

This command will write two new lines (`new line 1` and `new line 2`) to the pipe, and then the `cat` command will read the contents of the pipe and output them to the terminal.
