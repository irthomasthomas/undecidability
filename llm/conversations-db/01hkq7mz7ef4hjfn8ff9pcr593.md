**Prompt:**
In bash, I can write multiple requests to a named pipe like so: mkfifo my_pipe
for i in {1..5}; do
  echo "Request $i" > my_pipe &
  sleep 1
done.

How can I do the same in this lisp function?:

(define-command-global gh-send-selection-to-issue ()
    "Sends url, title and selection to new gh issue"
  (let* ((title (title (current-buffer)))
         (myurl (url (current-buffer)))
         (selection (ps-eval (ps:chain window (get-selection) (to-string))))
         (pipe-title "/tmp/nyxt_title")
         (pipe-url "/tmp/nyxt_url")
         (pipe-selection "/tmp/nyxt_selection"))
    (with-open-file (stream pipe-title
                           :direction :output
                           :if-exists :supersede
                           :if-does-not-exist :create)
      (write-string title stream))
    (with-open-file (stream pipe-url
                           :direction :output
                           :if-exists :supersede
                           :if-does-not-exist :create)
      (write-string (render-url myurl) stream))
    (with-open-file (stream pipe-selection
                           :direction :output
                           :if-exists :supersede
                           :if-does-not-exist :create)
      (write-string selection stream))))

**Response:**
To write multiple requests to a named pipe in Lisp, you can use a loop construct to iterate over the desired range and write to the pipe within each iteration. Here's how you can adapt the given Lisp function to write multiple requests to a named pipe:

```lisp
(define-command-global gh-send-selection-to-issue ()
  "Sends url, title and selection to new gh issue"
  (let* ((title (title (current-buffer)))
         (myurl (url (current-buffer)))
         (selection (ps-eval (ps:chain window (get-selection) (to-string))))
         (pipe "/tmp/nyxt_pipe"))
    (mkfifo pipe) ; Assuming mkfifo is a function that creates a named pipe
    (dotimes (i 5) ; Loop 5 times
      (with-open-file (stream pipe
                             :direction :output
                             :if-exists :append
                             :if-does-not-exist :create)
        (write-string (format nil "Request ~A~%" i) stream))
      (sleep 1)))) ; Sleep for 1 second between writes
```

In this adaptation:

- A single named pipe `/tmp/nyxt_pipe` is used instead of three separate pipes.
- The `mkfifo` function is assumed to create a named pipe (you would need to define this function to actually create the pipe, as Common Lisp does not have a built-in `mkfifo` function).
- The `dotimes` loop is used to iterate 5 times, corresponding to the bash loop `{1..5}`.
- Within the loop, `with-open-file` is used to open the pipe and write a string to it. The `:if-exists :append` argument ensures that each new request is appended to the pipe rather than overwriting the previous one.
- The `format` function is used to create the string "Request i" where `i` is the current iteration number.
- A `sleep` call is added to pause for 1 second between each write, as in the bash script.

Note that this code assumes the existence of a `mkfifo` Lisp function, which you would need to implement or replace with an appropriate system call to create the named pipe. Additionally, error handling and other practical considerations are omitted for brevity.
