**Prompt:**
write 10 cool zsh commands all uber-geeks must know

**Response:**
1. cd without typing the full path: Typing 'cd' followed by the first few letters of the directory's name, then hitting 'Tab' will automatically complete the directory name. For example, 'cd Doc' + 'Tab' = 'cd Documents', saving you time and keystrokes.

2. Auto-completion for commands and arguments: Zsh has powerful autocompletion capabilities. Start typing a command or argument, then hit 'Tab', and it will automatically complete based on available options.

3. Dir Previews: Typing 'ls' followed by 'Tab' will show a preview of the directories/files, similar to 'ls' but with visual icons and highlighting for different types of files.

4. Extended globbing: Zsh provides powerful extended globbing capabilities. For example, using the 'ls' command, typing '*.txt~*.doc' + 'Tab' will list all '.txt' files while excluding all '.doc' files in the current directory.

5. Command line editor shortcuts: Zsh offers a set of shortcuts to make navigating and editing the command line faster. For example, 'Ctrl + A' to move to the beginning of the line, 'Ctrl + E' to move to the end, 'Ctrl + W' to delete the word before the cursor, and so on.

6. History searching: Quickly search through your command history using 'Ctrl + R'. Start typing a command, and Zsh will search and display matching commands from your history.

7. Inline file editing: Use the 'v' command to open the current command line in your preferred text editor, allowing you to edit it more comfortably. Once you save and close the editor, the command will automatically be executed.

8. Recursive file globbing: Zsh allows you to easily find files recursively. For example, typing '**/*.txt' + 'Tab' will list all '.txt' files in the current directory and its subdirectories.

9. Generate random passwords: Use the 'apg' command along with some arguments to generate strong, random passwords. For example, 'apg -n 3 -m 10' will generate three passwords, each with a minimum length of ten characters.

10. Directory jumping: Zsh's 'cd' command is enhanced with the ability to jump to frequently accessed directories using aliases. For example, instead of 'cd /long/path/to/directory', you can create an alias like 'alias cdd="cd /long/path/to/directory"' and use 'cdd' to quickly jump to that directory.
