**Response:**
I'm sorry for the confusion, but it seems that the actual source code you want to be analyzed wasn't provided in the question. You've only provided a descriptor saying "**SOURCE_CODE**" followed by a request to explain how to extract the tip amount.

Nonetheless, if you're looking for a method to extract numerical values (such as a tip amount) from a text string, there are various ways to accomplish this based on the language and tools at hand. Here's a brief explanation using Python, which is known for its powerful text manipulation capabilities.

### Code Example in Python

Supposing you have a string that contains the tip amount somewhere inside it, you might use regular expressions to extract the amount. Python's `re` module would come in handy:

```python
import re

def extract_tip_amount(text):
    # This pattern looks for any sequence of digits (including decimal points) possibly preceded by a currency symbol
    pattern = r'\$?(\d+(?:\.\d+)?)'
    match = re.search(pattern, text)
    
    if match:
        # Convert the matched text to a floating point number
        return float(match.group(1))
    else:
        return None

text = "I would like to give you a tip of $20.00 for your excellent service."
tip_amount = extract_tip_amount(text)
print(f"The extracted tip amount is: {tip_amount}")
```

In this example, `extract_tip_amount` function takes a string `text` and looks for a pattern that matches a dollar amount. The `pattern` we're using here is `r'\$?(\d+(?:\.\d+)?)'`, which translates to:

- `\$?` - Optionally match the dollar symbol `$` (escaped because `$` has a special meaning in regex)
- `(\d+(?:\.\d+)?)` - Match a sequence of digits that can have an optional decimal part. This is captured in a group to extract the actual number.
  
When a match is found, it's converted from a string to a float using `float(match.group(1))`. If no match is found, `None` is returned.

### Performance Considerations
- The above Python code should be efficient for most uses as regular expressions are quite performant for text parsing in Python.
- The performance may suffer if the input string is extremely large or if this code is called repeatedly in a tight loop for a vast number of strings. In such cases, pre-compiling the regular expression with `re.compile()` can save some time by not having to compile the regex on each function call.

### Further Performance Improvements
Depending on the use case, there could be further optimizations:

- **Precompiled Regex**: If this code is running many times, precompiling the regex can save some overhead. Outside of the function, you'd have `pattern = re.compile(r'\$?(\d+(?:\.\d+)?)')`, and within the function, you'd use `pattern.search(text)` instead of `re.search(pattern, text)`.
- **Vectorization**: If extracting from multiple texts at once, and using a language or library that supports vectorized operations (like `pandas` in Python), it could be more efficient to apply the regex operation on the entire collection of strings at once, rather than iterating through them.
- **Platform-specific Tools**: If the text is within a large corpus of data or within a database, using database query language functions (like SQL's `REGEXP`) or full-text search engines (like ElasticSearch) could more efficiently extract these values in bulk.
- **String Methods**: If the pattern is very regular and simple, abandoning regex for string methods (like `split`, `find`, etc.) may be slightly faster since they are more rudimentary and have less overhead than regex. However, this is usually less flexible and robust against variations in the text.

Remember that premature optimization can often lead to more complex code that is harder to maintain, and the best optimization often comes from first ensuring that the algorithm is as simple and clear as it can be. After the algorithm is designed well, then you can profile your code to find bottlenecks and optimize where necessary.

Please provide the actual source code for an in-depth analysis and specific optimization suggestions, and I'll be happy to assist further.
