**Response:**
As there's no source code provided in your message, I'm unable to provide a line-by-line breakdown or suggest specific performance improvements for the given code. However, I can give you general advice on refactoring a Common Lisp function for performance improvements and best practices, specifically one that might be used with Nyxt browser (which is built with Common Lisp and leverages Lisp's power for extendability and customizability).

To improve performance and refactor a Nyxt browser function to send all the data to a single FIFO (file input/output) file, consider the following guidelines:

1. **Minimize System Calls**: Interacting with files can be expensive, especially if you're opening and closing the file frequently. You should open the FIFO file once, perform all necessary writes, and then close it when you're completely finished. This reduces the overhead of system calls. 

2. **Buffering Writes**: If you're writing to a file frequently, you might want to buffer the writes in memory and then flush the buffer to the file periodically or when the buffer reaches a certain size. This can greatly reduce the number of write operations to the disk, and thus improve performance.

3. **Concurrency**: If Nyxt is processing multiple things in parallel that need to write to the FIFO, consider using locking mechanisms to prevent race conditions. However, excessive locking can lead to contention and reduce performance, so use locks wisely.

4. **Avoid Blocking I/O**: Using non-blocking I/O can improve the responsiveness of Nyxt, especially if it's handling user input or other tasks concurrently. If the I/O operations are blocking the main thread, consider moving them to a separate thread or using asynchronous I/O if possible.

5. **Error Handling**: Robust error handling is crucial. Make sure the code checks for and properly handles any errors that might occur during file operations. This isn't directly related to performance, but it's essential for ensuring the reliability of the function.

6. **Data Structures**: Efficiently manipulate data in memory before writing it to the file. Choose the right data structures for the task at hand, which have good performance characteristics for your typical use cases (for example, appending to a list is O(n) in Lisp, so you might want to use vectors or other structures if this is a bottleneck).

7. **Modular Code**: Structure your code into small, reusable functions where appropriate. This can help with maintenance and potentially allow for easier optimization of specific parts of the code.

8. **Profiling**: Use profiling tools to identify bottlenecks in your code. In Common Lisp, tools like SBCL's built-in profiler can help you understand where the most time is being spent.

Without a specific code snippet, a general suggestion would involve writing a Common Lisp function that takes care of opening the FIFO file (using `open` with appropriate flags for writing), buffering data in memory (using lists or vectors), periodically flushing this buffer to the file (this could be triggered by buffer size or by time intervals), and closing the file when done (using `close`).

Lastly, if the data involved is structured and complex, using serialization formats such as JSON or s-expressions for representation might improve both performance and maintainability when writing to or reading from the FIFO file.

For a more concrete and tailored suggestion, please provide the actual source code of the function you wish to refactor, and I'll be happy to give you a detailed breakdown and performance optimization tips specific to that code.
