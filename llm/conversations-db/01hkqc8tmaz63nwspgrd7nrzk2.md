**Response:**
The request seems to be about refactoring a function in Nyxt browser that is written in Common Lisp. Nyxt is a keyboard-oriented, extensible web browser designed for power users, which is very customizable. However, to provide a detailed code analysis and suggestions for improvement, I would actually need to see the source code of the function in question.

As of my knowledge cutoff in April 2023, Nyxt browser functions that handle data might encompass a range of operations from processing bookmarks, history, buffer data, to handling downloads or sending commands to the renderer process.

Assuming we are dealing with a generic function meant to interact with a FIFO (named pipe), here’s a breakdown of what an inefficient version of such a function might look like, followed by a suggestion for improvement. Note that this is a hypothetical example:

```lisp
(defun send-to-fifo-inefficient ()
  (let ((fifo-path "/path/to/fifo"))
    ;; Open the FIFO for writing.
    (with-open-file (stream fifo-path
                            :direction :output
                            :if-exists :append
                            :if-does-not-exist :create)
      ;; Get all the different pieces of data.
      (let ((data1 (get-data1))
            (data2 (get-data2))
            (data3 (get-data3)))
        ;; Write each piece of data to the FIFO.
        (write-string data1 stream)
        (write-string data2 stream)
        (write-string data3 stream)))))
```

Performance issues and anti-patterns that might be present in this hypothetical code:

1. The function opens the FIFO file for each writing operation which is inefficient if the operation is performed frequently. This opening and closing could introduce unnecessary overhead.
2. Assuming `get-data1`, `get-data2`, and `get-data3` are independent calls that compute or retrieve data, this function does not take advantage of potential concurrency or parallelism.
3. The data is written to the FIFO in separate calls, which could lead to more syscalls than necessary.

To improve this function:

- We can reuse the stream instead of opening it every time if the FIFO is meant to be a continuous channel that stays open during the application's runtime.
- If `get-data*` functions are independent and their results aren't dependent on one another, we can parallelize their calls to improve the data retrieval performance.
- Buffer all the data into one large write operation to minimize syscalls and the associated overhead.

Here's an example of a refactored and more efficient version, assuming that parallelism and a single write operation are applicable and do not interfere with the program’s logic:

```lisp
(defun send-to-fifo-efficient ()
  (let* ((fifo-path "/path/to/fifo")
         ;; Initialize the FIFO only once if it can be reused.
         ;; You would ideally do this outside of the function
         ;; if the FIFO should stay open for the entire lifetime of the program.
         (stream (open fifo-path
                       :direction :output
                       :if-exists :append
                       :if-does-not-exist :create)))
    ;; Ensure the stream gets closed properly upon exiting the block.
    (unwind-protect
         (let ((data1 (get-data1))   ; These could potentially be fetched in parallel
               (data2 (get-data2))   ; For example, using `lparallel` or `bordeaux-threads`
               (data3 (get-data3)))
           ;; Combine data into a single write operation.
           (write-string (format nil "~A~A~A" data1 data2 data3) stream))
      ;; Ensure that the stream gets closed no matter what.
      (close stream))))
```

To take advantage of parallelism in Common Lisp, you can use libraries like `lparallel` or `bordeaux-threads`, creating a thread for each data retrieval and then combining the results.

In any refactor, it's also important to ensure that the new code:
- Maintains the same functional output as the original unless requirements have changed.
- Handles errors gracefully and clean up resources.
- Is well-documented, especially since you're presenting this to an audience that may have high standards for code quality.

Lastly, for an additional performance edge, you might want to consider using other Common Lisp features or libraries that compile to more efficient machine code, or an entirely different approach that takes advantage of the operating system features more directly. The actual solution depends heavily on the details of the original function and the context in which it's used, which have not been provided in your question.

If you can share the actual source code of the function in question, I would be able to offer a more concrete suggestion.
