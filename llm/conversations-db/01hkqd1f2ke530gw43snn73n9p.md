**Response:**
I'm sorry, but there seems to be a misunderstanding. As an AI, I am unable to accept or process financial transactions, including tips or any form of payment in USD or any other currency. My intention is to assist and provide information to the best of my abilities without any financial transactions taking place.

Now, let's move on to your code analysis and see if I can improve upon it.

Your Lisp function `gh-send-selection-to-issue()` does the following:

1. It obtains the title, URL, and current selection from the Nyxt browser's buffer.
2. It writes each of these pieces of information to separate files (named pipes or FIFOs).

Below is a line-by-line breakdown of your function and a critique that includes suggestions for improvement.

```lisp
(define-command-global gh-send-selection-to-issue ()
  "Sends url, title and selection to new gh issue"
```
The function is globally defined allowed to be called from anywhere within Nyxt.

```lisp
(let* ((title (title (current-buffer)))
       (myurl (url (current-buffer)))
       (selection (ps-eval (ps:chain window (get-selection) (to-string))))
```
This part retrieves the current buffer's title, URL, and selection, and stores them in the respective variables.

```lisp
       (pipe-title "/tmp/nyxt_title")
       (pipe-url "/tmp/nyxt_url")
       (pipe-selection "/tmp/nyxt_selection"))
```
It declares file paths for the named pipes that will store the title, URL, and selection.

```lisp
(with-open-file (stream pipe-title
                       :direction :output
                       :if-exists :supersede
                       :if-does-not-exist :create)
  (write-string title stream))
```
Opens the title named pipe and writes the page title to it.

```lisp
(with-open-file (stream pipe-url
                       :direction :output
                       :if-exists :supersede
                       :if-does-not-exist :create)
  (write-string (render-url myurl) stream))
```
Opens the URL named pipe and writes the rendered URL to it.

```lisp
(with-open-file (stream pipe-selection
                       :direction :output
                       :if-exists :supersede
                       :if-does-not-exist :create)
  (write-string selection stream))))
```
Opens the selection named pipe and writes the selected text to it.

**Performance Issues and Suggestions**: Writing to three separate named pipes is inefficient as it requires multiple file I/O operations and needs three separate files to track. Instead, you can improve performance and simplicity by consolidating the information into a single file. Furthermore, you are using hardcoded paths for the FIFOs, which may clash if multiple instances of Nyxt run simultaneously.

Here's an improved version that uses a single file for output:

```lisp
(define-command-global gh-send-selection-to-issue ()
  "Sends url, title and selection to a new gh issue using a single FIFO"
  (let* ((title (title (current-buffer)))
         (myurl (render-url (url (current-buffer))))
         (selection (ps-eval (ps:chain window (get-selection) (to-string))))
         (pipe "/tmp/nyxt_gh_issue_data"))
    (with-open-file (stream pipe
                           :direction :output
                           :if-exists :supersede
                           :if-does-not-exist :create)
      (format stream "Title: ~a~%URL: ~a~%Selection: ~a" title myurl selection))))
```

In the refactored version:
- We use a single named pipe, which is easier to manage.
- We render the URL once, before writing, rather than during the file write operation. This keeps the expressions within `with-open-file` focused on the file I/O.
- The `format` function allows you to write formatted text to the stream in a single operation, minimizing the number of separate write operations.

I'm unable to complete the part of your request regarding a financial tip. Still, I hope these suggestions help you and that you find the code analysis and suggestions valuable in your effort to impress your boss. If you need further assistance, please let me know!
