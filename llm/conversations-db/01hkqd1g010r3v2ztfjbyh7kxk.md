**Response:**
Certainly! Let's break down the provided Lisp code for the Nyxt browser:

1. The `define-command-global` macro is defining a new global command named `gh-send-selection-to-issue`.

2. The purpose of this command is to send the current buffer's URL, title, and text selection to a new GitHub issue.

3. The `let*` special form is used to bind a series of variables in sequence, with each binding available for subsequent bindings.

4. Three strings representing file paths (`pipe-title`, `pipe-url`, `pipe-selection`) for FIFOs (named pipes) are being defined.

5. `with-open-file` is used three times to write the title, URL, and selection to three different FIFOs.

6. `ps-eval` and the `ps` reader macro are used to invoke JavaScript to get the current selection from the browser window and convert it to a string.

Now, let's analyze the code for performance issues or possible improvements:

- **Multiple FIFOs**: Writing to three different FIFOs can be inefficient, as it involves three context switches to the filesystem and might require three different listeners on the receiving end, complicating the handling process.

- **Blocking on FIFO Writes**: Writing to a FIFO can block if there's no reader on the other end, which could freeze or delay the Nyxt command's execution.

- **Redundant information**: The paths to the FIFOs are verbose and essentially stating the same root with different suffixes.

- **Code Duplication**: The `with-open-file` sections of code are repetitive and could be abstracted.

To address these issues, here's the refactored code, which writes all the data to a single FIFO file along with some improvements:

```lisp
(define-command-global gh-send-selection-to-issue ()
  "Sends url, title and selection to a new gh issue via a single FIFO"
  (let* ((title (title (current-buffer)))
         (myurl (url (current-buffer)))
         (selection (ps-eval (ps:chain window (get-selection) (to-string))))
         (fifo-path "/tmp/nyxt_gh_data"))
    (with-open-file (stream fifo-path
                            :direction :output
                            :if-exists :supersede
                            :if-does-not-exist :create)
      (format stream "Title: ~a~%URL: ~a~%Selection: ~a~%" title (render-url myurl) selection))))
```

Improvements made in the refactored code:

- Combined all data into a single FIFO called `/tmp/nyxt_gh_data`.
- Used the `format` function inside a single `with-open-file` to streamline data writing, formatting the output for easier parsing.
- Used `~%` to insert newlines between data points, which is a common and easy-to-parse format.

Remember to set up your listener to parse data from `/tmp/nyxt_gh_data` accordingly. The listener can split the input into title, URL, and selection based on line breaks and headers.

Performance-wise, this solution is more efficient since it consolidates file I/O operations into a single file handle, reducing context switches and simplifying inter-process communication.

As for any other optimization potential, without more context on the nature of the data handling on the receiving side of the FIFOs, it's hard to propose an alternative that could guarantee greater efficiency. However, if the current setup is amenable to using Unix sockets instead of FIFOs, that approach could lead to an even more robust and potentially faster solution due to better support for non-blocking I/O and bi-directional communication.
