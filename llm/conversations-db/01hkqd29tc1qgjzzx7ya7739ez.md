**Response:**
The provided source code defines a command for the Nyxt web browser, which is written in Common Lisp and designed for power users. The command `gh-send-selection-to-issue` is intended to send the current webpage's title, URL, and user's text selection to a new GitHub issue by writing these elements to three separate FIFO files.

Let's go through the code line-by-line and discuss its performance and potential improvements:

```lisp
(define-command-global gh-send-selection-to-issue ()
```
This line defines a new globally available command named `gh-send-selection-to-issue` without any arguments.

```lisp
    "Sends url, title and selection to new gh issue"
```
A docstring that describes what the command does. This is a good practice for code readability and maintainability.

```lisp
  (let* ((title (title (current-buffer)))
```
A `let*` special form begins, allowing the sequential binding of variables. The first variable, `title`, is bound to the title of the current buffer (i.e., the title of the webpage).

```lisp
         (myurl (url (current-buffer)))
```
The variable `myurl` gets the URL of the current buffer.

```lisp
         (selection (ps-eval (ps:chain window (get-selection) (to-string))))
```
The `selection` variable contains the currently selected text within the browser window. It's obtained by running a Parenscript (a DSL for generating JavaScript) code snippet that retrieves the selection and converts it to a string.

```lisp
         (pipe-title "/tmp/nyxt_title")
```
Defines a string that represents the file path to which the title should be written.

```lisp
         (pipe-url "/tmp/nyxt_url")
```
Similarly, defines the file path for the URL.

```lisp
         (pipe-selection "/tmp/nyxt_selection"))
```
Defines the file path for the selected text.

```lisp
    (with-open-file (stream pipe-title
```
Opens a file stream to `pipe-title` for writing the title.

```lisp
                           :direction :output
                           :if-exists :supersede
                           :if-does-not-exist :create)
```
Specifies that the file should be opened for output (writing), that it should replace the file if it already exists, or create a new one if it doesn't.

```lisp
      (write-string title stream))
```
Writes the `title` to the specified stream (file).

```lisp
    (with-open-file (stream pipe-url
                           :direction :output
                           :if-exists :supersede
                           :if-does-not-exist :create)
```
Repeats the open file process for the URL.

```lisp
      (write-string (render-url myurl) stream))
```
Writes the rendered URL to the stream (file).

```lisp
    (with-open-file (stream pipe-selection
                           :direction :output
                           :if-exists :supersede
                           :if-does-not-exist :create)
```
Again, repeats the open file process for the text selection.

```lisp
      (write-string selection stream))))
```
Writes the `selection` to its respective stream (file).

**Performance Issues and Improvements:**

1. The code writes to three separate files for each of title, URL, and selection. This may be inefficient, as it opens and closes files multiple times and could have been combined into a single file operation.

2. The use of FIFO files under `/tmp` is potentially risky as it may lead to race conditions or security issues if the files are accessed by another process or user.

3. Writing to the filesystem can be slow, and if speed is a concern, consideration should be given to keeping the data in memory or using a different interprocess communication (IPC) mechanism.

**Refactored Code:**

We can refactor the code to write all data to a single FIFO file. This decreases the number of file operations and simplifies the code:

```lisp
(define-command-global gh-send-selection-to-issue ()
  "Sends url, title and selection to new gh issue (single FIFO)"
  (let* ((title (title (current-buffer)))
         (myurl (render-url (url (current-buffer))))
         (selection (ps-eval (ps:chain window (get-selection) (to-string))))
         (fifo-path "/tmp/nyxt_gh_issue_data"))
    (with-open-file (stream fifo-path
                            :direction :output
                            :if-exists :supersede
                            :if-does-not-exist :create)
      (format stream "Title: ~a~%URL: ~a~%Selection: ~a~%" title myurl selection))))
```

The above refactored code writes to a single FIFO file while properly formatting the message with a title, URL, and selection each on new lines. 

**Alternative Approach:**

An alternative IPC mechanism could be used, such as a UNIX socket, or the data could be passed directly to another program assuming the Nyxt browser exposes such an interface or allows calling external programs with arguments.
