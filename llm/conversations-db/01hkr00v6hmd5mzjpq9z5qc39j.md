# These GH Tricks Will Make Your Markdown Dazzle

Welcome to this guide on how to spruce up your GitHub README.md files. Markdown is a lightweight and easy-to-use syntax for styling all forms of writing on GitHub. With these tips and tricks, you can create engaging and highly informative READMEs that stand out in the community.

## Basic Markdown Syntax

Before we delve into the tricks, let's cover some Markdown basics for those who might be new to it:

- **Headers** are created using `#` symbols. `#` is h1, `##` is h2, and so on.
- **Bold** text is created with `**bold text**`.
- **Italic** text is created with `*italic text*`.
- **Links** are added with `[link text](URL)`.
- **Images** are embedded with `![alt text](image URL)`.
- **Lists** come in unordered (`-` or `*` for bullet points) and ordered (`1. item 1`).
- **Code** can be included inline with backticks \` or in blocks with three backticks ``` or tildes ~~~.

## Tricks to Enhance Your README

### Table of Contents

To help users navigate your README, create an interactive Table of Contents (ToC). Markdown doesn‚Äôt have built-in support for this, but you can create one manually by linking to different sections of your document:

```markdown
## Table of Contents
- [Introduction](#introduction)
- [Installation](#installation)
- [Usage](#usage)
- [Contributing](#contributing)
```

### Badges

Badges can provide quick visual cues about the project. Use shields.io or similar services to generate badges indicating build status, test coverage, package versions, and more.

```markdown
![GitHub license](https://img.shields.io/github/license/your-username/your-repo.svg)
```

### Emojis

Bring life to your README with emojis. You can add them by copying from an emoji cheat sheet or using colon syntax:

```markdown
I love making READMEs :heart:!
```

### Custom Images and GIFs

You can demonstrate your application‚Äôs functionality or workflow with custom images or GIFs. Hosting them on GitHub or an external service and embedding them is easy:

```markdown
![Demo](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/your-image-url.gif)
```

### Collapsible Sections

If your README has a lot of information, consider using collapsible sections. These make your document more navigable:

<details>
  <summary>Click to expand!</summary>
  
  ```markdown
  Here's more detailed information about the section.
  ```
</details>

Here's how to create one:

```markdown
<details>
  <summary>Section Title</summary>
  
  All the details you want to hide by default.
  
</details>
```

### Highlighting Text

Use blockquotes to highlight important information or to style notes and warnings:

```markdown
> :warning: This feature is not stable!
```

### Task Lists

If you want to show a to-do list or progress, use task lists:

```markdown
- [x] Task 1 completed
- [ ] Task 2 pending
```

### Mentioning Users and Teams

You can mention users or teams to draw their attention or give credit by using `@username` or `@team` within your markdown.

### Custom HTML and CSS

While GitHub's Markdown parser sanitizes many HTML tags for security reasons, you can still use a subset of HTML to achieve custom effects not otherwise available in Markdown:

```html
<p align="center">
  <img src="https://your-image-url.png" alt="centered image" />
</p>
```

### Automated TOC Generation

Some external tools and GitHub Actions can automatically generate a Table of Contents for you when you push your markdown file.

### Embed YouTube Videos

Although not directly supported in Markdown, you can embed YouTube videos using a simple HTML image link that points to the video's thumbnail and links to the video URL.

```html
[![Watch the video](https://img.youtube.com/vi/<VIDEO_ID>/maxresdefault.jpg)](https://youtu.be/<VIDEO_ID>)
```

### Including Mathematical Expressions

Use LaTeX style syntax to include mathematical expressions. GitHub supports this through MathJax:

```latex
$$
e^{i\pi} + 1 = 0
$$
```

## Conclusion

By using these tricks, your GitHub README.md files will not only be informative but also engaging and well-organized. Happy documentation writing! üéâ

---

Remember that Markdown syntax and capabilities can change, and GitHub may update its features occasionally. Always keep an eye out for new and updated GitHub features and markdown extensions to improve your project documentation further!

**Prompt:**
Given the following prompt, how should I add the output and links to my markdown docs?

Tools

## browser

You have the tool `browser` with these functions:
  'perform_bing_search(query: str)': when provided a user query.
  'process_search_results': if the search results contain the info needed to answer the user query.
  'perform_bing_search' again if the search results do not contain the info needed for an authoritative answer to the users query.
For citing quotes from the 'browser' tool: please render in this format: `&#8203;``„Äêoaicite:0„Äë``&#8203;`.
For long citations: please render in this format: `[link text](message idx)`.

**Response:**
To incorporate the output and links from the `browser` tool into your Markdown docs, you'll want to follow a format that provides clear and readable citations and references to external content sourced through the tool's search functions. Below, I'll give you an example of how to format short and long citations in your Markdown documentation:

### Example Usage of `browser` Tool in Markdown

Let's say you conducted a search to find information about a particular topic using the `browser` tool and you want to present both the search process and the results in your Markdown documentation.

```markdown
## Research with the Browser Tool

During the course of our project, we used the `browser` tool to perform searches and process the results for relevant information. Here's an outline of our procedure:

1. We began by initiating a search query using the `perform_bing_search` function.
   
   ```python
   perform_bing_search('example search query')
   ```

2. After receiving the search results, we used the `process_search_results` function to extract the necessary information.
3. If the initial results were insufficient, we repeated the search with adjusted query parameters.

### Citing Search Results

#### Short Citations

Short citations for direct quotes or referenced information were included using the prescribed format. For example:

> "This is an example quote from the search results" &#8203;``„Äêoaicite:0„Äë``&#8203;.

#### Long Citations

For more extensive information or when linking out to full resources, we utilized the following format to include hyperlinks in our documentation:

For more details on this topic, please refer to [this link](message idx).

#### Example Section with Citation

Here is how we might present information in a section of the documentation with proper citations:

### Insights on Example Topic

Our research on the topic using the `browser` tool provided significant insights. The concept of 'example theory' is pivotal in this area and is explained as follows:

> "Example theory revolutionized our understanding of examples in real-world applications." &#8203;``„Äêoaicite:0„Äë``&#8203;.

For an in-depth analysis of 'example theory' and its implications, the results from our second search can be found in the full article [here](message idx).
```

### Notes:

- Replace `'example search query'`, `„Äêoaicite:0„Äë`, and `(message idx)` with the actual search query you used, the citation index provided by the `browser` tool, and the message index for the source, respectively.
- Use the short citation format for direct quotes or small pieces of information.
- Use the long citation format to link to full articles or external pages for extended reading.
- Ensure that any citations or links you include are accurate and correspond to the correct sources or indexes provided by the `browser` tool during your research process.

**Response:**
# Comprehensive Guide to Hugging Face Tokenizers

Hugging Face's tokenizers are essential tools designed to prepare inputs for various models offered by the Hugging Face Transformers library. With a range of features and functionalities, these tokenizers proficiently tokenize text, which is the process of converting raw text into a format understandable by models.

## Tokenization Basics

At the core of the Hugging Face's tokenizer is the ability to take a string of text and convert it into a sequence of tokens. Tokens are the building blocks of natural language processing (NLP) and represent pieces of the input text (e.g., words or subwords). The library offers both Python and "Fast" tokenizer implementations, with the latter being based on the Rust library and providing a performance boost [[source](https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers/main_classes/tokenizer)].

## Encoding Methods

Hugging Face tokenizers come with various encoding methods:

- `__call__`
- `encode`
- `encode_plus`

While `encode` converts text to a sequence of token IDs, `encode_plus` provides additional information like input IDs, attention masks, and token type IDs, all returned in a dictionary. These are crucial for training transformer models as they help with sequence classification tasks and distinguishing between multiple sentences, respectively [[source](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/61708486/whats-difference-between-tokenizer-encode-and-tokenizer-encode-plus-in-hugging)].

## Batch Encoding

`BatchEncoding` is a container for the output from the tokenizer's encoding methods, which includes functionalities to make arrays of tokens uniform in size for batching purposes through special tokens that are later ignored by attention mechanisms or during loss computation [[source](https://huggingface.co/transformers/v3.5.1/main_classes/tokenizer.html)].

## Return Tensors

An important feature of Hugging Face tokenizers is the `return_tensors` parameter. This allows the output to be returned as tensors rather than lists of Python integers. The parameter accepts values for different libraries, including TensorFlow (`tf`), PyTorch (`pt`), and Numpy (`np`), fitting seamlessly into the appropriate computational graph [[source](https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers/internal/tokenization_utils)].

## Preprocessing Data

A tokenizer class is also available for data preprocessing in NLP tasks. The class can tokenize text into words or subwords and then create a numerical representation of the tokens in the form of tensors. This preparation is essential for further processing in deep learning models [[source](https://huggingface.co/transformers/v3.0.2/preprocessing.html)].

## Special Functions

For more intricate requirements, tokenizers also provide methods like `word_to_tokens`, which maps a word to its corresponding tokens within a batch sequence. This functionality showcases the tokenizer's ability to handle complex relationships within input data [[source](https://huggingface.co/transformers/v3.0.2/_modules/transformers/tokenization_utils_base.html)].

## Tokenization Schemes

Efficient tokenization techniques implemented by Hugging Face include Byte-Pair Encoding (BPE) and WordPiece, all serving different use-cases like size efficiency and representational richness. Understanding these schemes is crucial when devising effective NLP pipelines [[source](https://flowgpt.gitbook.io/prompt-engineering-guide/group-7/tools-and-frameworks-for-prompt-engineering/hugging-face-transformers)].

## Practical Example

To use Hugging Face tokenizers in practice, you might use a snippet like the following for the BERT model:

```python
from transformers import BertTokenizer

tokenizer = BertTokenizer.from_pretrained('bert-base-uncased')
encoding = tokenizer.encode_plus("Hello, world!", return_tensors="pt")
```

Here, `return_tensors="pt"` specifies that the output should be a PyTorch tensor. The `encode_plus` method provides a dictionary with various essential components of the encoded text.

## Conclusion

This guide provides a synthesis of the tokenization process and functionalities provided by Hugging Face tokenizers. With the ability to seamlessly integrate with several deep learning frameworks and handle a variety of tokenization schemes, Hugging Face's tokenizers are powerful tools in the arsenal of any data scientist working in NLP.
