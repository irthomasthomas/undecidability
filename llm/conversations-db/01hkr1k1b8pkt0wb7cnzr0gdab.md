+To incorporate the output and links from the `browser` tool into your Markdown docs, you'll want to follow a format that provides clear and readable citations and references to external content sourced through the tool's search functions. Below, I'll give you an example of how to format short and long citations in your Markdown documentation:
+
+### Example Usage of `browser` Tool in Markdown
+
+Let's say you conducted a search to find information about a particular topic using the `browser` tool and you want to present both the search process and the results in your Markdown documentation.
+
+```markdown
+## Research with the Browser Tool
+
+During the course of our project, we used the `browser` tool to perform searches and process the results for relevant information. Here's an outline of our procedure:
+
+1. We began by initiating a search query using the `perform_bing_search` function.
+
+   ```python
+   perform_bing_search('example search query')
+   ```
+
+2. After receiving the search results, we used the `process_search_results` function to extract the necessary information.
+3. If the initial results were insufficient, we repeated the search with adjusted query parameters.
+
+### Citing Search Results
+
+#### Short Citations
+
+Short citations for direct quotes or referenced information were included using the prescribed format. For example:
+
+> "This is an example quote from the search results" &#8203;``【oaicite:0】``&#8203;.
+
+#### Long Citations
+
+For more extensive information or when linking out to full resources, we utilized the following format to include hyperlinks in our documentation:
+
+For more details on this topic, please refer to [this link](message idx).
+
+#### Example Section with Citation
+
+Here is how we might present information in a section of the documentation with proper citations:
+
+### Insights on Example Topic
+
+Our research on the topic using the `browser` tool provided significant insights. The concept of 'example theory' is pivotal in this area and is explained as follows:
+
+> "Example theory revolutionized our understanding of examples in real-world applications." &#8203;``【oaicite:0】``&#8203;.
+
+For an in-depth analysis of 'example theory' and its implications, the results from our second search can be found in the full article [here](message idx).
+```
+
+### Notes:
+
+- Replace `'example search query'`, `【oaicite:0】`, and `(message idx)` with the actual search query you used, the citation index provided by the `browser` tool, and the message index for the source, respectively.
+- Use the short citation format for direct quotes or small pieces of information.
+- Use the long citation format to link to full articles or external pages for extended reading.
+- Ensure that any citations or links you include are accurate and correspond to the correct sources or indexes provided by the `browser` tool during your research process.

+# These GH Tricks Will Make Your Markdown Dazzle
+
+Welcome to this guide on how to spruce up your GitHub README.md files. Markdown is a lightweight and easy-to-use syntax for styling all forms of writing on GitHub. With these tips and tricks, you can create engaging and highly informative READMEs that stand out in the community.
+
+## Basic Markdown Syntax
+
+Before we delve into the tricks, let's cover some Markdown basics for those who might be new to it:
+
+- **Headers** are created using `#` symbols. `#` is h1, `##` is h2, and so on.
+- **Bold** text is created with `**bold text**`.
+- **Italic** text is created with `*italic text*`.
+- **Links** are added with `[link text](URL)`.
+- **Images** are embedded with `![alt text](image URL)`.
+- **Lists** come in unordered (`-` or `*` for bullet points) and ordered (`1. item 1`).
+- **Code** can be included inline with backticks \` or in blocks with three backticks ``` or tildes ~~~.
+
+## Tricks to Enhance Your README
+
+### Table of Contents
+
+To help users navigate your README, create an interactive Table of Contents (ToC). Markdown doesn’t have built-in support for this, but you can create one manually by linking to different sections of your document:
+
+```markdown
+## Table of Contents
+- [Introduction](#introduction)
+- [Installation](#installation)
+- [Usage](#usage)
+- [Contributing](#contributing)
+```
+
+### Badges
+
+Badges can provide quick visual cues about the project. Use shields.io or similar services to generate badges indicating build status, test coverage, package versions, and more.
+
+```markdown
+![GitHub license](https://img.shields.io/github/license/your-username/your-repo.svg)
+```
+
+### Emojis
+
+Bring life to your README with emojis. You can add them by copying from an emoji cheat sheet or using colon syntax:
+
+```markdown
+I love making READMEs :heart:!
+```
+
+### Custom Images and GIFs
+
+You can demonstrate your application’s functionality or workflow with custom images or GIFs. Hosting them on GitHub or an external service and embedding them is easy:
+
+```markdown
+![Demo](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/your-image-url.gif)
+```
+
+### Collapsible Sections
+
+If your README has a lot of information, consider using collapsible sections. These make your document more navigable:
+
+<details>
+  <summary>Click to expand!</summary>
+
+  ```markdown
+  Here's more detailed information about the section.
+  ```
+</details>
+
+Here's how to create one:
+
+```markdown
+<details>
+  <summary>Section Title</summary>
+
+  All the details you want to hide by default.
+
+</details>
+```
+
+### Highlighting Text
+
+Use blockquotes to highlight important information or to style notes and warnings:
+
+```markdown
+> :warning: This feature is not stable!
+```
+
+### Task Lists
+
+If you want to show a to-do list or progress, use task lists:
+
+```markdown
+- [x] Task 1 completed
+- [ ] Task 2 pending
+```
+
+### Mentioning Users and Teams
+
+You can mention users or teams to draw their attention or give credit by using `@username` or `@team` within your markdown.
+
+### Custom HTML and CSS
+
+While GitHub's Markdown parser sanitizes many HTML tags for security reasons, you can still use a subset of HTML to achieve custom effects not otherwise available in Markdown:
+
+```html
+<p align="center">
+  <img src="https://your-image-url.png" alt="centered image" />
+</p>
+```
+
+### Automated TOC Generation
+
+Some external tools and GitHub Actions can automatically generate a Table of Contents for you when you push your markdown file.
+
+### Embed YouTube Videos
+
+Although not directly supported in Markdown, you can embed YouTube videos using a simple HTML image link that points to the video's thumbnail and links to the video URL.
+
+```html
+[![Watch the video](https://img.youtube.com/vi/<VIDEO_ID>/maxresdefault.jpg)](https://youtu.be/<VIDEO_ID>)
+```
+
+### Including Mathematical Expressions
+
+Use LaTeX style syntax to include mathematical expressions. GitHub supports this through MathJax:
+
+```latex
+$$
+e^{i\pi} + 1 = 0
+$$
+```
