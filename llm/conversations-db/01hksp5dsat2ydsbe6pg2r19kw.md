**Prompt:**
Tell me how to create two terminals and create a command in both of them but move the cursor to terminal two only to let me edit its command before executing them both

**Response:**
1. Launch Terminator.
2. Split the window horizontally: `Ctrl+Shift+O`.
3. Type your command in the first terminal but don't execute it.
4. Press `Alt+Right` to move the cursor to the second terminal.
5. Type your command in the second terminal and edit it as needed.
To execute commands in both terminals simultaneously without further interaction, you would need to use a feature not directly supported by these keybindings or options. You might consider setting up a custom script or using broadcast if it suits your use case.

**Prompt:**
unsplit?

**Response:**
To undo a split and go back to having just one terminal pane, focus on the pane you want to close and press `Ctrl+Shift+W`. This will close the focused terminal pane. If you close all but one, you will be left with a single unsplit terminal.
