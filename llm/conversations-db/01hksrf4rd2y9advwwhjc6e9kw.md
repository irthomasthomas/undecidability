**Prompt:**
alt+a does not work, it looks like it sends a return or something. It just creates a new buffer line. I am using arch linux kde plasma 5. Maybe something else is capturing alt+a, but I dont see any keyboard shortcuts assigned in settings.

**Response:**
It's possible that `Alt+A` is being intercepted by another application or by KDE Plasma's global shortcuts before it reaches Terminator. To troubleshoot and resolve the issue, you can try the following steps:

1. Verify if there's any hidden global shortcut in KDE Plasma that uses `Alt+A`. Go through System Settings > Shortcuts to check for conflicts.

2. Check your application-specific shortcuts to ensure none of them are set to `Alt+A`.

3. If you're running any other applications that might capture keyboard shortcuts globally, like window managers or tools for managing keybindings, check their configurations as well.

4. If you still can't find the conflict, as a workaround, you can modify Terminator's keybindings to use a different shortcut for broadcasting to all terminals. This can typically be done through the Terminator preferences menu (right-click the terminal > Preferences > Keybindings).

5. Finally, you may try using another user account or resetting the KDE Plasma settings to default as a last resort to ensure it's not a user-specific configuration causing the issue.
