**Prompt:**
Is there a way to do this without the torch dependency while keeping cuda support?

**Response:**
<<<domain>>>: Natural Language Processing Text Classification
<<<api_call>>>: model = AutoModelForSequenceClassification.from_pretrained('cross-encoder/ms-marco-MiniLM-L-12-v2')
<<<api_provider>>>: Hugging Face Transformers
<<<explanation>>>:1. We import the necessary libraries and functions from the Hugging Face Transformers library.
2. We load the pretrained model 'cross-encoder/ms-marco-MiniLM-L-12-v2' for the task of Information Retrieval.
3. We use the model to score the relevance of an answer in a conversation to the query provided.
4. The higher the score, the more relevant the answer is.<<<code>>>:

answer = 'Renewable energy sources are those that can be replenished naturally in a relatively short amount of time, such as solar, wind, hydro, geothermal, and biomass. Non-renewable energy sources, on the other hand, are finite and will eventually be depleted, such as coal, oil, and natural gas. Here are some key differences between renewable and non-renewable energy sources:'
