**Prompt:**
Order of magnitude

**Response:**
The order of magnitude refers to the approximate size or scale of a number or quantity, usually expressed as a power of 10. It provides an understanding of the approximate magnitude or scale of a value without requiring the exact calculation. 

For example, if the order of magnitude of a number is 10^0, it means the number is approximately equal to 1. If the order of magnitude is 10^1, it means the number is approximately equal to 10. Similarly, an order of magnitude of 10^-1 represents a number approximately equal to 0.1. 

The order of magnitude can help in simplifying calculations, understanding the scale of a problem, or making rough estimations.

**Prompt:**
What would be an order of magnitude smaller than 10 Billion?

**Response:**
An order of magnitude smaller than 10 billion would be 1 billion. Since an order of magnitude is determined by multiplying or dividing by a factor of 10, dividing 10 billion by 10 gives 1 billion.
