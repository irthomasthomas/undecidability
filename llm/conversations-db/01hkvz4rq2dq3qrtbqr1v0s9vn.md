**Prompt:**
What is the meaning?

**Response:**
The phrase you've provided is a mix of Italian and English. When translated to English completely, it means:

"I want to say, he is not our Cheshire Cat."

This could be interpreted in a literal or figurative sense depending on the context:

1. **Literal Meaning**: If used in the context of a discussion about Lewis Carroll's "Alice in Wonderland," where the Cheshire Cat is a character known for his mischievous grin and ability to disappear, the speaker could be indicating that a particular cat is not the actual Cheshire Cat from the story.

2. **Figurative Meaning**: More commonly, this sentence is likely to be used metaphorically to imply that a certain individual or thing does not possess the qualities or characteristics typically associated with the Cheshire Cat - such as being enigmatic, elusive, or having a particular kind of presence.

In both cases, "the Cheshire Cat" serves as a point of comparison, and the speaker is emphasizing that the subject (a person, animal, or even situation) they are referring to lacks the attributes that would make it comparable to the concept or character of the Cheshire Cat. The phrase "Voglio dire" shows that the speaker is trying to clarify or correct a potential misconception or to emphasize a point.
