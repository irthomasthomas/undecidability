**Prompt:**
What does it mean, figuratively to call someone a cheshire cat?

**Response:**
Figuratively, calling someone a "Cheshire Cat" typically refers to their behavior or demeanor rather than their physical appearance. It alludes to Lewis Carroll's character from "Alice's Adventures in Wonderland," where the Cheshire Cat is known for its prominent smile that remains visible even after its body disappears. 

Thus, when someone is referred to as a Cheshire Cat, it implies that they have a mysterious or enigmatic nature, often characterized by a playful or mischievous smile. It suggests that the person is cunning, often with a tendency to be secretive or unpredictable, and may possess a whimsical or sly personality.
