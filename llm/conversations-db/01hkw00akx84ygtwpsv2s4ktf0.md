Production ready AI assistant framework

The Cheshire Cat is a framework to build custom AIs on top of any language model. If you have ever used systems like WordPress or Django to build web apps, imagine the Cat as a similar tool, but specific for AI.

Quickstart

To make Cheshire Cat run on your machine, you just need docker installed:

docker run --rm -it -p 1865:80 ghcr.io/cheshire-cat-ai/core:latest
Chat with the Cheshire Cat on localhost:1865/admin.
You can also interact via REST API and try out the endpoints on localhost:1865/docs
As a first thing, the Cat will ask you to configure your favourite language model. It can be done directly via the interface in the Settings page (top right in the admin).

Enjoy the Cat!
Follow instructions on how to run it with docker compose and volumes.

"Would you tell me, please, which way I ought to go from here?"
"That depends a good deal on where you want to get to," said the Cat.
"I don't much care where--" said Alice.
"Then it doesn't matter which way you go," said the Cat.
