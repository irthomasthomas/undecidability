**Prompt:**
what do I do after git stash, git pull...

**Response:**
After running `git stash` to temporarily save your changes and then running `git pull` to update your local branch with the latest changes from the remote repository, you can follow these steps:

1. Run `git stash apply` or `git stash pop` to reapply your stashed changes to the updated branch.

- If you used `git stash apply`, your changes will still be available in the stash, so you can apply them again if needed.
- If you used `git stash pop`, your changes will be reapplied and removed from the stash. However, if there are conflicts during the reapplication, you may need to resolve them manually.

2. Review the changes you pulled from the remote branch. You can use `git log` or a visual Git tool to examine the commit history.

3. If there are any conflicts, you need to resolve them. Git will automatically detect conflicting lines and mark them in the affected files. Open those files, locate the conflicts, and make the necessary changes to resolve them. Once resolved, save the files.

4. After resolving conflicts, run `git add <file>` for each resolved file to mark them as resolved.

5. If needed, run `git stash drop` to remove any leftover stash that is no longer needed.

6. Finally, you can continue with your development or create a new branch to work on by using `git branch <branch-name>`.

Remember to always test your changes thoroughly after the pull, especially if you had conflicting changes that you resolved.
