**TASK**
**disable a gpu or hide it from cuda devices


**Response:**
To disable a GPU or hide it from CUDA devices, you can use the `nvidia-smi` command with the `--id` option to specify the GPU ID and the `--compute-mode` option to set the compute mode to "0" (Default mode). Here's the command:

```bash
nvidia-smi --id=<gpu_id> --compute-mode=0
```

Replace `<gpu_id>` with the ID of the GPU you want to disable or hide. You can find the GPU ID by running the `nvidia-smi` command without any options.
