**Prompt:**
Using as few words as required.
    Explain this bash code to a linux expert. 
    Mention any serious errors:
     sudo nvidia-smi drain -p 0000:0b:00.0 -m 0  

**Response:**
The command attempts to set a GPU with PCI address 0000:0b:00.0 into a "drain state" using NVIDIA's System Management Interface (nvidia-smi), where it will not accept new work. The `-m 0` flag is likely incorrect; it should be `-m single` for single GPU or `-m multi` for all GPUs. If `-m 0` is not a valid option, the command will fail.

**Prompt:**
Switch which gpu get used by the operating system, arch and kde etc?

**Response:**
To change the GPU used by the OS, such as Arch Linux with KDE, adjust the Xorg configuration or use a tool like `prime-select`. There's no simple command; the process involves:

1. Installing drivers for the new GPU.
2. Configuring Xorg by editing `/etc/X11/xorg.conf` or files in `/etc/X11/xorg.conf.d/`.
3. Optionally, using tools like optimus-manager for Optimus laptops.
4. Restarting the display manager or the system.

Note: The above guidelines are general; specifics can vary based on the hardware and drivers involved.
