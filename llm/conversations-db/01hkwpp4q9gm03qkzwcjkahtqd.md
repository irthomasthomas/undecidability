**Prompt:**
search for a model

**Response:**
<<<domain>>>: Natural Language Processing Question Answering
<<<api_call>>>: model = AutoModelForQuestionAnswering.from_pretrained('deepset/xlm-roberta-large-squad2')
<<<api_provider>>>: Transformers
<<<explanation>>>:1. Import the necessary components from the Transformers library.
2. Load the pretrained XLM-RoBERTa large model for question answering.
3. Create a question answering pipeline using the model.
4. Ask a question and provide an answer to test the model.<<<code>>>:
from transformers import pipeline, AutoModelForQuestionAnswering

def load_model(model_name):
    model = AutoModelForQuestionAnswering.from_pretrained(model_name)
    nlp = pipeline('question-answering', model=model)
    return nlp

def process_data(nlp, question, context):
    response = nlp(question=question, context=context)
    return response

model_name = 'deepset/xlm-roberta-large-squad2'
question = 'What are the key differences between renewable and non-renewable energy sources?'
context = 'Here are some key differences between renewable and non-renewable energy sources:'

# Load the model and process the data
nlp = load_model(model_name)
response = process_data(nlp, question, context)

print(response)
