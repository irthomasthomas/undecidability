**Prompt:**
What is the most efficient algorithm for sorting an array of integers?


**Response:**

The most efficient general purpose sorting algorithm is the merge sort. It has a time complexity of O(n log n), which is better than quicksort's average case of O(n log n) but worst-case O(n^2). The main reason for this difference in efficiency is that merge sort doesn't require any swaps, just comparisons and merges.

Here is the pseudocode for the merge sort algorithm:

```
function merge_sort(arr):
    if len(arr) <= 1:
        return arr

    mid = len(arr) // 2
    left = merge_sort(arr[:mid])
    right = merge_sort(arr[mid:])

    return merge(left, right)

function merge(left, right):
    merged = []
    i = j = 0

    while i < len(left) and j < len(right):
        if left[i] < right[j]:
            merged.append(left[i])
            i += 1
        else:
            merged.append(right[j])
            j += 1

    while i < len(left):
        merged.append(left[i])
        i += 1

    while j < len(right):
        merged.append(right[j])
        j += 1

    return merged
```

The merge sort algorithm works by recursively dividing the input array into two halves until each half is a single element, and then merging these subarrays back together in sorted order. The `merge` function takes two sorted arrays and merges them into a single sorted array. This function uses two pointers to iterate through both arrays, comparing elements from the left and right arrays and appending the smaller one to the merged array until both arrays are exhausted.

The worst-case time complexity of merge sort is O(n log n) because it performs n - 1 comparisons in each recursive call, and there are log n levels of recursion. The space complexity of merge sort is also O(n log n), since it requires an extra array to store the merged subarrays during the merging process. However, this space can be reused, so the actual space usage is O(1) for in-place merge sort variants.
