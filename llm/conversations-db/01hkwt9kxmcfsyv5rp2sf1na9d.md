**Prompt:**
What is a hash table and how is it used in programming?

**Response:**

    Hash Tables (also known as dictionaries, or associative arrays) are data structures that allow users to store key-value pairs. They're commonly used when we need fast access to stored elements. Essentially, they're an efficient way to map unique keys to values in a collection.

    Hash Tables use a hash function to generate the index of each element. This means that for any given input, we can quickly calculate its corresponding index in the table. In practice, this usually involves running the key through a hash function, and using the result as the index.

    One example of when you might want to use a hash table is if you were building a phone book application. The phone numbers (values) would be stored with the names (keys), allowing for quick lookup of phone numbers based on the name.
