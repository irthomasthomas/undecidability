**Prompt:**
Can you explain what polymorphism means in object-oriented programming?

**Response:**


In object-oriented programming, polymorphism refers to the ability of objects of different classes to respond differently to the same message. This is a powerful feature that allows for more flexible and maintainable code. Here's an example:

```python
class Animal:
    def __init__(self, name):
        self.name = name

    def speak(self):
        raise NotImplementedError("Subclasses must implement this method.")

class Dog(Animal):
    def speak(self):
        return f"{self.name} barks."

class Cat(Animal):
    def speak(self):
        return f"{self.name} meows."

animals = [Dog("Fido"), Cat("Fluffy")]

for animal in animals:
    print(animal.speak())
```

In this example, we have a base class `Animal` with an abstract method `speak()`. The classes `Dog` and `Cat` inherit from `Animal`, and each implements their own version of the `speak()` method. When we create instances of these classes and call the `speak()` method on them, they will respond differently based on their type.

Polymorphism allows us to treat objects of different types in a uniform way while still allowing for specialized behavior. This makes it easier to write code that works with multiple types of objects without having to worry about their specific implementations.
