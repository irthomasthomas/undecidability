**Prompt:**
8. What is an object-relational mapping (ORM) framework, and how is it used in application development?

**Response:**

  Object-Relational Mapping (ORM) framework is a tool that helps developers map objects to database records. It provides a mechanism for converting data between relational databases and the object model of an application. This allows applications to interact with a relational database through a set of entities rather than SQL statements.

ORM frameworks are used in application development to abstract away the complexity of writing SQL queries, managing transactions, handling relationships between tables, and other tasks related to working with databases. They simplify the process of developing data-driven applications by providing a higher level of abstraction that is closer to the programming language syntax used by developers.

Using an ORM framework can reduce code duplication, improve performance, and enhance productivity while developing applications that interact with relational databases. Some popular ORM frameworks include Hibernate, NHibernate, ActiveRecord, and Entity Framework.
