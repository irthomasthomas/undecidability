**Prompt:**
5. Explain the difference between stack and heap memory allocation.

**Response:**


Heap memory allocation is a type of dynamic memory allocation where the user program requests memory from the system during runtime and uses it to store data. Memory on the heap is not automatically freed or reallocated when the scope ends, this must be done manually by the user. The heap has no constraints on its size and can grow as large as the available virtual memory of the system.

Stack memory allocation is a type of static memory allocation where the compiler allocates memory during compile time. This memory is freed automatically when the scope of the variable ends. The stack has a fixed maximum size, typically much smaller than that of heap, and can grow up to its maximum limit as needed by adding stack frames for each function call.

In general, stack memory is faster and more efficient for small objects and variables that are known at compile time, while heap memory allocation is more flexible and useful for larger, dynamic data structures or objects that are not known until runtime.
