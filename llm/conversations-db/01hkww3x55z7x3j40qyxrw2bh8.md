**Prompt:**
5. Explain the difference between stack and heap memory allocation.

**Response:**


The main difference between stack and heap memory allocations is that:
- Stack memory allocation is managed by compiler whereas heap memory allocation is managed manually by programmer.
- Memory allocated in stack is temporary whereas memory allocated in heap is permanent until deallocated explicitly.
- In stack, memory is allocated when a function is called and it will be freed up automatically when the function call returns. But in case of heap, memory should be allocated and freed up manually by the programmer using malloc() or free() functions.
- Memory allocation in stack is faster compared to heap allocation as the process is automatic whereas allocation in heap is slower as it requires more system resources.
- Stack memory allocations are of fixed size whereas heap allocation can be dynamically increased or decreased at runtime.
- In case of stack, overflow leads to segmentation fault but in case of heap, overflow may not lead to segmentation fault and may cause other issues.
