**Prompt:**
5. Explain the difference between stack and heap memory allocation.

**Response:**


Stack memory allocation:
- Stored in stack segment of the computer's memory.
- Memory is allocated at compile time.
- Memory is automatically deallocated after the function call completes (when the block scope ends).
- Useful for storing local variables and parameters.
- Faster than heap memory allocation because it does not require any runtime overhead, but has limitations due to its size (usually a few kilobytes) and data lifetime (automatically deallocated when a function returns).

Heap memory allocation:
- Stored in heap segment of the computer's memory.
- Memory is allocated at runtime using malloc or new functions.
- Memory has to be manually freed by programmer using free or delete functions, otherwise it leads to memory leaks.
- Useful for storing large data structures and dynamic data that needs more control over its lifetime.
- Slower than stack memory allocation due to its overhead of searching for an appropriate block of memory (or reallocating when needed).
