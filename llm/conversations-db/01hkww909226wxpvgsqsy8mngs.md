**Prompt:**
3. How would you implement a binary search algorithm?

**Response:**


A binary search is an efficient way of searching for a value in an array sorted either in ascending or descending order. The basic concept behind the binary search algorithm is to divide the search space into two halves until the desired element is found. It works on the principle of divide and conquer, which means dividing the problem into smaller subproblems and solving them individually.

Here's a simple implementation in Python:

```python
def binary_search(array, value):
    low = 0
    high = len(array) - 1

    while low <= high:
        mid = (low + high) // 2

        if array[mid] == value:
            return mid
        elif array[mid] < value:
            low = mid + 1
        else:
            high = mid - 1

    return None
```

In this function, we take an input list and the value we are searching for. We initialize two pointers, one at the start of the array (`low`) and another at the end (`high`). Then, we enter a loop that continues as long as `low` is less than or equal to `high`.

Inside the loop, we find the middle index (`mid`) by calculating the average of `low` and `high`. If the value at this index matches our target value, we return the index. Otherwise, if it's smaller than our target value, we update the `low` pointer to be greater than `mid`. This means that our search space will now be the right half of the array.

If the value at the middle index is larger than our target value, we update the `high` pointer to be less than `mid`, which means we're searching in the left half of the array.

The loop continues until either the desired element is found or the search space has been exhausted (i.e., there are no more elements to compare). If we don't find the value, we return `None`.
