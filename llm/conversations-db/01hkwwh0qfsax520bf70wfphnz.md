**Prompt:**
3. How would you implement a binary search algorithm?

**Response:**


A binary search algorithm is an efficient way to find an element in a sorted array. The idea is to use the middle index of the array as a reference point, compare it with the target value we're looking for and then eliminate half of the remaining array based on the comparison result until we find our target or reach a case where there are no more elements left.

Here is a Python implementation of binary search:

```python
def binary_search(arr, val):
    low = 0
    high = len(arr) - 1
    
    while low <= high:
        mid = (low + high) // 2
        
        if arr[mid] == val:
            return mid
        elif arr[mid] < val:
            low = mid + 1
        else:
            high = mid - 1
    return -1
```

This function takes in two arguments: the sorted array and the value we're looking for. The `low` variable is set to 0, which is the index of the first element in our array. The `high` variable is set to the last index of the array.

Then it enters a loop that continues as long as `low` is less than or equal to `high`. In each iteration, we calculate the middle index by taking the average of `low` and `high`, which ensures that our midpoint will always be an integer value.

Next, we check if the value at this midpoint matches the target value. If it does, we return the index of the midpoint. If not, we check whether the value at the midpoint is less than the target value. If so, we update `low` to be the next index after `mid`. Otherwise, we update `high` to be the previous index before `mid`.

Finally, if no match is found and the loop ends, we return -1 to indicate that the target value isn't in our array.
