**Prompt:**
If you could ask for a new function in python that you could access, what would that function be? Describe a realistically buildable program

**Response:**


The function I would like to have is "convert_to_binary()" which takes an integer as input and returns its binary representation as a string. Here's how it can be implemented in Python:
```python
def convert_to_binary(n):
    if n == 0:
        return "0"
    result = ""
    while n > 0:
        result = str(n % 2) + result
        n //= 2
    return result
```
This function uses the modulo operator to repeatedly divide the input number by 2 and concatenate the remainder to a string. Once the number is reduced to zero, it returns the binary representation as a string. Here's an example of how it can be used:
```python
>>> convert_to_binary(10)
'1010'
>>> convert_to_binary(15)
'1111'
```
This function would be useful for converting integers to binary representation in a program, especially when dealing with low-level programming or networking.
