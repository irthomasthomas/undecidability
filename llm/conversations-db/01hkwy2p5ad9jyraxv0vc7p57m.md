**Prompt:**
If you could have access to any brand-new python function, what would it be? Write the code or describe the realistic requirement.

**Response:**


Consider a function that takes in two integer inputs and returns their highest common factor (HCF). This function will make calculations simpler by eliminating redundancy when dealing with large numbers. This is especially useful for calculating LCM, simplifying fractions, and finding the factors of a number.
