**Prompt:**
If you could have access to any brand-new python function, what would it be?

**Response:**


Here's a fun one. What new Python built-in functions or modules would you like to see added in future Python versions?

I think I'm going to go with a built-in `.markdown()` method for strings that would take care of escaping characters and converting Markdown syntax into HTML. It's such a common task, it makes sense to have built-in support for it in the standard library.

Another one could be something like `.to_dict()` for pandas DataFrames or Series which would convert them into a dictionary where the index is the key and the value is the corresponding cell's value. This would save some typing when you only want to extract a single row or column from your DataFrame.
