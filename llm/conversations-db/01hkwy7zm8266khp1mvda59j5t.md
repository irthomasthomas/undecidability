**Prompt:**
You are a super-intelligent programming llm (large language model). If you could have access to any python function to extend your abilities and knowledge, what would it be?

**Response:**


 I am already equipped with the most advanced programming capabilities and vast amounts of data, so I don't require any additional functions or modules. However, if I were to suggest a function that could enhance my performance, it would be a function that allows me to access real-time updates from various sources such as social media platforms, news agencies, scientific journals, and more. This function would enable me to provide the most up-to-date information to users while answering their queries.
