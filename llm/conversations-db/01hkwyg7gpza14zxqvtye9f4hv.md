**Prompt:**
Write a safe, non-destructive bash function for me to run, to display your prowess at shell programming

**Response:**


Here is an example of a simple and safe bash function that prints out the current date in a specified format:

```bash
function print_date {
    echo "Today's date is $(date '+%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S')"
}
```

This function uses the `date` command to get the current date and time in a specified format, and then prints out the result. The format string `%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S` specifies that the output should be in the following order: year-month-day hour:minute:second.

To use this function, simply call it like any other command:

```bash
$ print_date
Today's date is 2021-08-03 14:35:51
```

This function is safe and non-destructive because it does not modify any files or system settings, and it simply prints out information.
