**Prompt:**
**USER_QUESTION:**
Which of these are important for performance? Inference speed and efficiency? I have two gpus, 1 with 12GB vram and the other 8GB vram. I also have 16 cores, 32 threads and 64GB system ram. Suggest some advanced options to try. Then synthesize a series of commands to test to see which perform better.
**END_USER_QUESTION**


**Response:**
To improve the performance of the llamacpp-python application for inference speed and efficiency, you can consider the following advanced options:

1. **Model placement on GPUs**: You can specify the number of layers to put on the GPU using the `--n_gpu_layers` option. To take full advantage of your GPUs, you can allocate more layers to the GPU with higher VRAM. For your setup, you can assign 12 layers to the GPU with 12GB VRAM and the remaining layers to the GPU with 8GB VRAM.

2. **Tensor splitting**: If you want to split layers across multiple GPUs, you can use the `--tensor_split` option. You can provide the proportion of layers to be allocated on each GPU. For example, you can allocate 75% of the layers on the GPU with 12GB VRAM and 25% on the GPU with 8GB VRAM.

3. **Number of threads**: You can adjust the number of threads used by the llamacpp-python application using the `--n_threads` and `--n_threads_batch` options. It is recommended to set these values based on the available CPU cores. For your setup, you can set `--n_threads` and `--n_threads_batch` to 16.

4. **Batch size**: You can experiment with different batch sizes using the `--n_batch` option. Larger batch sizes can potentially improve performance, but they also require more VRAM. You can start with the default value of 512 and try increasing it if your VRAM allows.

5. **Offloading KQV**: By using the `--offload_kqv` option, you can offload the computation of key, query, and value tensors (KQV) to the GPU, which can potentially improve performance.

Here is a series of commands to test different configurations:

1. Allocate 12 layers to the GPU with 12GB VRAM and the remaining layers to the GPU with 8GB VRAM, split with 75% on the first GPU and 25% on the second GPU:
```shell
python __main__.py --model <path_to_model> --n_gpu_layers 12 --main_gpu 0 --tensor_split 75 25
```

2. Allocate all layers to the GPU with 12GB VRAM:
```shell
python __main__.py --model <path_to_model> --n_gpu_layers -1 --main_gpu 0
```

3. Offload KQV computation to the GPU with 12GB VRAM:
```shell
python __main__.py --model <path_to_model> --offload_kqv
```

4. Increase the batch size to 1024:
```shell
python __main__.py --model <path_to_model> --n_batch 1024
```

You can try these commands and measure the inference speed and efficiency for each configuration to find the best-performing option for your setup.
