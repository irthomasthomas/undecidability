# üõ†Ô∏è Advanced Uses of the GitHub API in the Linux Terminal

## üîç Search Repositories
The GitHub API provides a powerful search endpoint that allows you to find repositories based on various criteria. Here's an example command that uses `curl` to search for all repositories with the word "python" in their name:
```
curl -u 'your_username' https://api.github.com/search/repositories?q=language:python&sort=stars
```
## üë• Get User Information
The GitHub API provides an endpoint that allows you to retrieve information about a user. Here's an example command that uses `curl` to get information about the user "defunkt":
```
curl -u 'your_username' https://api.github.com/users/defunkt
```
## üì¶ Get Repository Information
The GitHub API provides an endpoint that allows you to retrieve information about a repository. Here's an example command that uses `curl` to get information about the "vim" repository:
```
curl -u 'your_username' https://api.github.com/repos/vim/vim
```
## üîß Create and Update Issues
The GitHub API provides endpoints that allow you to create and update issues in a repository. Here's an example command that uses `curl` to create an issue in the "vim" repository:
```
curl -u 'your_username' https://api.github.com/repos/vim/vim/issues -d '{"title":"Test Issue","body":"This is a test issue."}'
```
## üß™ Test API Endpoints with Postman
Postman is a popular tool for testing APIs, and it can be used to test the GitHub API. Here's an example command that uses `postman` to create an issue in the "vim" repository:
```
postman --request POST https://api.github.com/repos/vim/vim/issues --data '{"title":"Test Issue","body":"This is a test issue."}'
```
## üí° Use the GitHub CLI Tool
The GitHub CLI tool provides a convenient way to interact with the GitHub API from the command line. Here's an example command that uses `gh` to create an issue in the "vim" repository:
```
gh issue create --repo vim/vim --title "Test Issue" --body "This is a test issue."
```
## üíª Automate Tasks with GitHub Actions
GitHub Actions provides a powerful workflow automation tool that can be used to automate tasks such as building and deploying code, running tests, and more. Here's an example command that uses `curl` to create a new GitHub Action:
```
curl -u 'your_username' https://api.github.com/repos/{owner}/{repo}/actions/workflows -d '{"name":"Test Workflow","state":"active","event":"push"}'
```
## üìà Visualize GitHub Data with GraphQL
The GitHub API provides a GraphQL endpoint that allows you to query data in a more efficient way. Here's an example command that uses `graphql` to get information about the "vim" repository:
```
graphql -f vim.gql -F username=your_username
```
## ‚úçÔ∏è Write GitHub Markdown with Pandoc
Pandoc is a powerful tool for converting files from one markup format to another, and it can be used to write GitHub markdown in the terminal. Here's an example command that uses `pandoc` to convert a markdown file to HTML:
