# Advanced Uses of GitHub API in Linux Terminal
## Introduction
GitHub API is a powerful tool that can be used to automate tasks and integrate with other tools. In this document, we will discuss some advanced uses of GitHub API in the Linux terminal.
## Authentication
To use the GitHub API, you need to authenticate yourself using a personal access token. You can create one from your GitHub account settings. Once you have created a personal access token, you can use it as follows:
```
$ export GITHUB_TOKEN=<your-token>
```
## Repository Information
You can use the GitHub API to get information about a repository using its name and owner. For example, to get information about the `reactjs/react-router` repository, you can use the following command:
```
$ curl -H "Authorization: token $GITHUB_TOKEN" https://api.github.com/repos/reactjs/react-router | jq .
```
This will return a JSON object containing information about the repository such as its name, description, and owner.
## Create a Repository
You can create a new repository using the GitHub API with the following command:
```
$ curl -X POST -H "Authorization: token $GITHUB_TOKEN" https://api.github.com/user/repos -d '{"name":"your-repo","description":"description","private":true}'
```
This will create a new repository with the name `your-repo`, a description of your choice, and set it to be private.
## Clone a Repository
You can clone a repository using the GitHub API with the following command:
```
$ curl -H "Authorization: token $GITHUB_TOKEN" https://api.github.com/repos/<owner>/<repo>/git/trees/<tree-hash> | jq .
```
This will return a JSON object containing information about the repository such as its name, description, and owner.
## Clone a Repository
You can clone a repository using the GitHub API with the following command:
```
$ curl -H "Authorization: token $GITHUB_TOKEN" https://api.github.com/repos/<owner>/<repo>/git/trees/<tree-hash> | jq .
```
This will return a JSON object containing information about the repository such as its name, description, and owner.
## Conclusion
The GitHub API is a powerful tool that can be used to automate tasks and integrate with other tools in the Linux terminal. By using authentication, you can access private repositories and create new ones. Additionally, you can use the API to get information about repositories and clone them.
