**Prompt:**
Write a bash terminal command to achieve the following task.
Be concise, but include as much code as needed. Do not write anything else. Ever.

**TASK**
**ignore the .scratchpad dir in gh or git


**Response:**


To ignore the `.scratchpad` directory in Git, you can add it to your `.gitignore` file. Here's how:

```bash
echo ".scratchpad/" >> .gitignore
```

This command will append the line `.scratchpad/` to the end of your `.gitignore` file, effectively ignoring the `.scratchpad` directory in Git.
