**Response:**


GitHub is a tool that many developers use to manage their code. It provides version control for code files, which makes it much easier to track changes made by multiple users. GitHub also provides a way to display this code on the web using Markdown, a simple markup language.

Markdown is easy to learn and makes writing HTML feel like typing in plain text. It's great for blog posts or other documents where you want to include some formatting, but not have it look too cluttered.

However, GitHub has some features that are hidden away from the general public, and they're worth exploring. In this article, we'll cover some of them.

## Diagrams Markdown

In addition to standard Markdown syntax, GitHub also supports a few other types of markup languages. One such language is called Diagrams Markdown, which lets you draw diagrams directly in your README file or any other Markdown document on GitHub.

To use it, just write out the shapes and lines that make up your diagram in ASCII art and GitHub will render it as a vector graphic:

```markdown
```diagram
[S]--o[M]--o[E]
```
```

This will create an arrow connecting S to M, and then another one going from M to E. You can add more nodes by simply adding more letters (in alphabetical order).

## Mermaid Markdown

Another type of markup language supported by GitHub is called Mermaid Markdown. This allows you to create diagrams like flowcharts and sequence diagrams directly in your README file or any other Markdown document on GitHub:

```mermaid
graph TD;
    A-->B;
    A-->C;
    B-->D;
    C-->D;
```

This will create a flowchart with three nodes and two arrows. Again, you can add more nodes by simply adding more letters (in alphabetical order).

## 3D Rendering

GitHub also supports 3D rendering of certain file types, such as OBJ files:

```markdown
![3D model](path/to/your/model.obj)
```

This will create an interactive 3D model that you can rotate and zoom in on within the browser itself. This is perfect for showcasing your 3D models or other projects that use 3D graphics.

## Conclusion

GitHub's support for these advanced markup languages makes it a powerful tool for displaying code, diagrams, and even interactive 3D content on the web. By utilizing these features, you can create documents that are both visually appealing and informative. So go ahead and experiment with these hidden gems to make your GitHub projects stand out from the rest!
