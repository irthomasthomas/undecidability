+Creating a raw content outline for a new 'agents' section in a GitHub project can be much about balancing thorough documentation with readability and utility. Here is an example of how such a section might be structured in Markdown, with proposed next steps. This will assume a file structure and naming convention that fits in with the existing project:
+
+# Agents
+
+## Overview üåê
+
+Agents are autonomous or semi-autonomous entities within the 'undecidability' project that interact with code, data, and other systems to perform tasks, run trials, and aid in development.
+
+## Types of Agents ü§ñ
+
+- **Vision Agent**: Converts images to code snippets, creates diagrams, and assists with screen recordings.
+- **Trial Agent**: Engages in verification and code challenges, conducting trials and compiling reports on outcomes.
+- **Git Agent**: Manages version control integration, automates commit messages, and monitors repository health.
+- **Chatbot Agent**: Assists developers with queries and provides information on demand using natural language processing.
+
+## Key Features üóùÔ∏è
+
+- Automated workflow integration
+- Self-monitoring capabilities
+- API connectivity for enhanced functionality
+- Limited filesystem access to ensure security
+
+## Next Steps üõ§Ô∏è
+
+1. Develop a framework for each type of agent to operate within.
+2. Implement a prototype for a single agent, likely the Vision Agent, due to its straightforward application.
+3. Set up a logging system to allow agents to report activities and outcomes.
+4. Create a security model that defines what each agent can and cannot do within the system.
+5. Establish communication protocols between agents and other parts of the system.
+
+## Documentation Standards üìö
+
+Agents documentation should be written in a clear and consistent manner. Use mermaid diagrams and other advanced markdown features to illustrate complex relations and workflows.
+
+```mermaid
+graph LR;
+    A[Developer] -->|Creates/Updates Agent| B[Agent Framework];
+    B -->|Interacts with| C[Codebase];
+    B -->|Interacts with| D[FileSystem];
+    B -->|Interacts with| E[APIs];
+    C -->|Feedback to| A;
+    D -->|Logs| A;
+    E -->|Data Exchange| A;
+```
+
+Document each new feature and change comprehensively, tracking changes through the Git Agent.
+
+### Using Icons for Clarity üåü
+
+- Utilize icons to visually categorize sections and features for quick reference and a cleaner look.
+
+## Testing and Trials üî¨
+
+Detail methodologies for testing each agent's functionality and performance. Use continuous integration pipelines to automate testing processes.
+
+## Budget and Cost Tracking üí∞
+
+- Include a section for tracking development costs and operational budgets per agent using the Chatbot Agent for reporting and alerts.
+
+## Code Generation and API Integration üõ†Ô∏è
+
+- Prioritize the development of agents that can generate code and connect to APIs to expand their capabilities.

+   ```
+   ssh-keygen -t ed25519 -C "<email>"
+   ```
+   Press `Enter` to accept the default file location.
+3. Start the ssh-agent and add the private key:
+   ```
+   eval `ssh-agent -s`
+   ssh-add ~/.ssh/id_ed25519
+   ```
+4. Copy the public key to your clipboard:
+   ```
+   xclip -sel clip < ~/.ssh/id_ed25519.pub
+   ```
+5. Go to GitHub > Settings > SSH and GPG keys and add a new SSH key with the copied public key.
+
+## Cloning and Configuring Repository
+1. Fork the repository on GitHub.
+2. Clone your forked repository:
+   ```
+   git clone git@github.com:<username>/PowerInfer.git
+   ```
+3. Add the main repository as an upstream remote:
+   ```
+   cd PowerInfer
+   git remote add upstream git@github.com:SJTU-IPADS/PowerInfer.git
+   ```
+
+## Creating a New Feature
+1. Create a new branch for your feature:
+   ```
+   git checkout -b feature/your_feature_name
+   ```
+2. Make your changes to the code, add new files, etc.
+3. Stage your changes:
+   ```
+   git add .
+   ```
+4. Commit your changes:
+   ```
+   git commit -m "Your commit message"
+   ```
+
+## Proposing a Pull Request
+1. Push your branch to your forked repository:
+   ```
+   git push origin feature/your_feature_name
+   ```
+2. Install GitHub CLI (gh) if not installed already:
+   ```
+   yay -S github-cli
+   ```
+3. Authenticate with GitHub using the CLI:
+   ```
+   gh auth login
+   ```
+4. Create a pull request on GitHub:
+   ```
+   gh pr create
+   ```
+   Follow the prompts to complete the pull request creation.
+
+## Keeping Your Work Synced
+1. Before starting your work, fetch the latest changes from the upstream repository:
+   ```
+   git fetch upstream
+   ```
+2. Switch to your main branch:
+   ```
+   git checkout main
+   ```
+3. Merge the latest changes from the upstream repository into your local main branch:
+   ```
+   git merge upstream/main
+   ```
+4. Switch back to your feature branch:
+   ```
+   git checkout feature/your_feature_name
+   ```
+5. Merge the latest changes from your local main branch into your feature branch:
+   ```
+   git merge main
+
+## Downloading Changes from the Main Repository
+1. Fetch the latest changes from the upstream repository:
+   ```
+   git fetch upstream
+   ```
+2. Merge the latest changes from the upstream repository into your local branch (e.g., main or any other branch):
+   ```
+   git merge upstream/main
