**Response:**
The script you've posted consists of a bash script `nyxt_to_github.sh` which reads data from a FIFO (named pipe) and a Lisp script `gh-selection-to-issue.lisp` that is assumed to be written for the Nyxt browser which sends data to that FIFO. Here is a quick overview of the potential issues and solutions:

### Bash Script: `nyxt_to_github.sh`

1. Missing variables initialization:
   The variables `TITLE`, `URL`, and `SELECTION` should be initialized before entering the `monitor_nyxt_to_gh_pipe` function to ensure they start empty.

2. Appending with `+=` operator:
   In Bash, when appending to a string, you need a space around the operator. Replace the lines that append text with:
   ```bash
   TITLE+=" $line"
   URL+=" $line"
   SELECTION+=" $line"
   ```

3. Variables' scoping:
   In bash, functions do not create a new scope; therefore all variables are global unless declared as local. This can lead to unexpected behavior. If you want these variables to be local to the function, declare them as such using `local` within the function.

4. Handling of whitespace in the appending:
   Be careful with the handling of newlines and whitespaces when appending to your variables. Currently, you're adding a newline before the line which may not be what you want for the first line of each section.

Make the following changes to fix the above issues in the Bash script:

```bash
#!/bin/bash
# nyxt_to_github.sh

monitor_nyxt_to_gh_pipe() {
    local TITLE=""
    local URL=""
    local SELECTION=""
    local parsing_section=""
    while IFS= read -r line; do
        # ... rest of your case statement ...
        *)
            case $parsing_section in
                TITLE) TITLE+="$line"$'\n' ;;
                URL) URL+="$line"$'\n' ;;
                SELECTION) SELECTION+="$line"$'\n' ;;
            esac
            ;;
    esac
    done < "$fifo_path"
}

# ... rest of the script ...
```

### Lisp Script: `gh-selection-to-issue.lisp`

This script seems to be fine as per the provided code for the context of generating a selection and writing it to a FIFO. Ensure that this script is properly executed by Nyxt and that Nyxt has the necessary permissions to write to the FIFO.

One thing to check in the Lisp script is that `(ps-eval (ps:chain window (get-selection) (to-string)))` might produce `nil` if there's no selection, that might cause issues when interpreted by the bash script if it's expecting textual content every time. You may want to handle the potential of `nil` selection in Lisp to ensure robust behavior of your inter-process communication.

### Testing the Scripts

- Run the bash script on its own and ensure you do not receive any syntax errors.
- Test writing to the FIFO manually to check that the bash script correctly processes the input, e.g., using `echo "--BEGIN TITLE--Test Title--END TITLE--" > /tmp/nyxt_gh_data` and so on for URL and SELECTION.
- Ensure that the Nyxt browser is set up correctly to allow running the Lisp script and has access to the FIFO.

After having made the appropriate changes and tested each component, your script should run more reliably. If issues persist, thoroughly check the output and error messages to track down the specific issue, and modify your debug strategies accordingly.
