What is RAG ?

Large language models (LLMs) have become an integral part of our lives and work, transforming how we interact with information through their astonishing versatility and intelligence.

Despite their impressive capabilities, they are not without flaws. These models can produce misleading "hallucinations," rely on potentially outdated information, be inefficient when dealing with specific knowledge, lack depth in specialized fields, and fall short in reasoning abilities.

In real-world applications, data needs to be continually updated to reflect the latest developments, and the content generated must be transparent and traceable to manage costs and protect data privacy. Therefore, relying solely on these "black box" models is insufficient; we need more refined solutions to meet these complex demands.

In this context, Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) has risen to prominence as a groundbreaking trend in the age of artificial intelligence.\n
