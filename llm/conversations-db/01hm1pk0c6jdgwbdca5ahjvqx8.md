**Prompt:**
Help. On my arch linux system. When I open a link in a bash script to a web page, it opens in nyxt, but the nyxt browser window stays in the background until I activate it. This is in nyxt 3.0. from 2022 or 2023. How can I ensure that the nyxt browser window always displays after requesting a url from an external program?

**Response:**
The behavior of launched applications (such as Nyxt browser) concerning window focus and whether they appear in the foreground or background is often controlled by the window manager or desktop environment settings. This can vary greatly depending on your specific Linux setup.

However, if you are running a script and want to ensure that Nyxt gets focus on opening a link, you can try to use additional tools to bring the window to the front after launching it. The following is a general approach that might work depending on your Linux environment:

1. Make sure you have `wmctrl` installed. Install it using your package manager if you don't have it:
   ```sh
   sudo pacman -S wmctrl
   ```

2. Modify your Bash script to launch the URL with Nyxt and then use `wmctrl` to bring it to the front. The script may look something like this:

   ```bash
   #!/bin/bash

   URL="http://example.com"
   nyxt "$URL" &  # Launch Nyxt in the background
   NYXT_PID=$!

   # Wait for a short period to ensure Nyxt has started and had time to open the window
   sleep 2

   # Find the window ID of Nyxt and bring it to the front
   WMCTRL_WINDOW_ID=$(wmctrl -l | grep Nyxt | awk '{print $1}')
   
   # If Nyxt window ID was found, bring it to the front
   if [[ -n "$WMCTRL_WINDOW_ID" ]]; then
       wmctrl -i -a "$WMCTRL_WINDOW_ID"
   fi
   ```

Please note that this script assumes the title of the Nyxt window contains the string 'Nyxt'. Adjust the `grep` command accordingly if that's not the case.

Remember, window managers and desktop environments can have different rules about focusing windows and allowing scripts to raise windows above others. If the above script doesn't work, you may need to look into your window manager/desktop environment's documentation or settings to see if there are any rules or restrictions about focusing new windows.

If you're using a tiling window manager or a window manager with strict focus-follows-mouse rules, automatic focusing might be against the design of the window manager. In such cases, you may need to reconfigure your window manager to achieve the desired behavior.

**Prompt:**
Not multiple nyxt windows, but other applications with nyxt in the window title, like vs code with the nyxt config open

**Response:**
Understood, thank you for the clarification. If Nyxt does not exclusively appear in the window title, we need to be more cautious when parsing the output of `wmctrl -l`. One way to address this is to filter the list of windows for the program's executable name or another unique identifier that reliably points to the Nyxt browser window.

It's crucial to find a unique property of the Nyxt browser window to target it with `wmctrl`. Unfortunately, without knowing the exact details of all running windows, it can be difficult to craft a one-size-fits-all command. However, we can make some assumptions and adjustments.

This improved script will attempt to focus the Nyxt window, assuming that it has a unique property (such as class name) that can be found using `xprop` and `wmctrl`.

```bash
#!/bin/bash

URL="http://example.com"
nyxt "$URL" &  # Launch Nyxt in the background
NYXT_PID=$!

# Wait for Nyxt to hopefully start
sleep 2

# Attempt to find the window ID of Nyxt assuming 'Nyxt' is part of WM_CLASS
WIN_ID=$(wmctrl -lx | awk '/nyxt.Nyxt/ {print $1}')

# If Nyxt window ID was found, bring it to the front
if [[ -n "$WIN_ID" ]]; then
    wmctrl -i -a "$WIN_ID"
fi
```

In this script, `wmctrl -lx` lists windows along with their class name. The `awk` command filters for lines that include `nyxt.Nyxt`. Adjust the filtering part `'nyxt.Nyxt'` to match the WM_CLASS of the Nyxt browser. You can find the WM_CLASS by running the command `xprop | grep WM_CLASS` and clicking on the Nyxt browser window.

This script relies on the assumption that your window manager or desktop environment allows a script to focus or raise a window. If it doesn't work as expected, you might need to tweak your window manager's settings or the script to fit your specific setup.

Please be aware that this solution is not foolproof and might not work in all environments or configurations. If multiple instances of Nyxt are open or other complexities arise, more sophisticated logic may be needed to ensure the correct window is focused.

Here are the windows. The correct one is the bottom. It will always start with 'Nyxt - '

0x0360000a  0 Desk ~ : nyxt — Konsole
0x05e09a3a  0 Desk sh /home/thomas/Development/Projects/llm/label-maker/nyxt_to_github_v2.sh
0x0340003e  0 Desk nyxt opens in background - Kagi Search — Mozilla Firefox
0x07400003  0 Desk Nyxt - *Settings* - nyxt:common-settings?section=%1Btext-and-code

**Response:**
Given the information you provided, it looks like windows that are related to Nyxt start with "Nyxt - ". Therefore, you can modify your script to only focus windows with this pattern.

Here's an updated version of the script that uses this pattern to identify the correct Nyxt window and then uses `wmctrl` to bring it into focus:

```bash
#!/bin/bash

URL="http://example.com"
nyxt "$URL" &  # Launch Nyxt in the background
NYXT_PID=$!

# Wait for Nyxt to hopefully start
sleep 2

# Attempt to find the window ID of the window with "Nyxt - " at the beginning of its title
WIN_ID=$(wmctrl -l | grep "^.*Nyxt - " | awk '{print $1}')

# If the Nyxt window ID was found, bring it to the front
if [[ -n "$WIN_ID" ]]; then
    wmctrl -i -a "$WIN_ID"
fi
```

The `grep` command now uses a regular expression pattern to filter the windows list. The "Nyxt - " prefix tells the script to find a window title that starts with "Nyxt - ". The `awk` command extracts the window ID from the filtered line.

Again, please note that the script's ability to raise a window depends on your window manager's/desktop environment's focusing policies. Please confirm that such scripts are allowed to change window focus, as some environments might require additional configuration or may not support this behavior at all.
