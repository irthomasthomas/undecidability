**Prompt:**
Great. Now loop forever over a fifo pipe.

**Response:**
Looping forever over a named pipe (FIFO) is a scenario you might encounter in Linux or other Unix-like operating systems. To demonstrate how this can be done, I'll provide you with an example using the Bash shell. However, keep in mind that I cannot execute or create actual pipes and loops here; I can only show you how the code would look.

```bash
#!/bin/bash

PIPE=/tmp/my_fifo

# First ensure the FIFO pipe exists
if [[ ! -p $PIPE ]]; then
    mkfifo $PIPE
fi

# Now we can start an infinite loop to read from the pipe
while true; do
    if read line <$PIPE; then
        if [[ "$line" == 'quit' ]]; then
            break
        fi
        # Process the line read from the FIFO here
        echo "Read from FIFO: $line"
    fi
done

echo "Exiting loop"
```

Here's what's happening in this script:

1. We define the path to our FIFO as "/tmp/my_fifo".
2. We check if the FIFO exists, and if it doesn't, we create it with `mkfifo`.
3. We enter an infinite loop using `while true`.
4. Inside the loop, we read from the FIFO with `read line <$PIPE`.
5. We also include a condition to exit the loop if we read the word "quit".
6. Once a line is read, we can process it as needed. Here, we simply output it with `echo`.
7. If you ever need to exit the loop, you could echo 'quit' > /tmp/my_fifo from another terminal or process.

Remember that FIFOs block on reads until there is data to read. So, the `read line <$PIPE` command will wait until there is something in the FIFO to read.

To use this script, save it to a file, give it execution permissions with `chmod +x scriptname.sh`, and execute it. Then in another terminal, you can send data to the pipe with `echo 'your-message' > /tmp/my_fifo` and it will be read and processed by the script. When you're done and want the loop to exit, just send `echo 'quit' > /tmp/my_fifo`.

Please use this responsibly as infinite loops can consume system resources if not handled with care.

**Prompt:**
Can you simplify and make so I can paste it into terminal?

**Response:**
Certainly! Here's a simplified version of the script that you can easily copy and paste into your terminal:

```bash
#!/bin/bash

PIPE=/tmp/my_fifo

[[ ! -p $PIPE ]] && mkfifo $PIPE

while read line <$PIPE; do
    [[ "$line" == 'quit' ]] && break
    echo "Read from FIFO: $line"
done

echo "Exiting loop"
```

After copying the script into your terminal, press Enter to execute it. Then, you can send data to the named pipe by running `echo 'your-message' > /tmp/my_fifo`. The script will continuously read from the pipe and display the received messages. If you want to exit the loop, send the command `echo 'quit' > /tmp/my_fifo`.

Remember to adjust the `PIPE` variable if you'd like to use a different named pipe path.
