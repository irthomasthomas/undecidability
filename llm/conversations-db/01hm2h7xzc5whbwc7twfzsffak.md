    else:
        print("Invalid input type.")
```

Key modifications and assumptions:
- Merged the functionality to work with both screenshots and video frames.
- Allowed the user to choose between screenshot narration and video frame narration.
- Used the OpenAI client from the `narator.py` script for consistency.
- Functions shared between scripts (`take_screenshot`, `calculate_similarity`, etc.) are maintained as in `screencast-narrator.py`.
- The `extract_frames` and `narrate_frames` functions from `narator.py` are integrated with a user-provided path to process video instead of screenshots.
- The script will now request user input to select the mode (screenshot or video) and provide the necessary paths/input.
- It is assumed that the environment is correctly configured with the necessary libraries, API keys are set as environment variables, and system support for commands (such as `aplay`).
- Error handling and validation (e.g., for user input and file paths) are minimally maintained from the original scripts. Additional robustness could be added as needed.
