**Response:**
The code has several issues that need fixing, specifically:

1. `interval` default value discrepancy in the docstring and the function signature.
2. `similarity_threshold` default value discrepancy.
3. Mismanagement of screenshot paths, leading to non-existent file references.
4. Potential resource waste and error from not managing screenshot files properly.
5. The `os.remove()` call may fail if files are not handled correctly.
6. The `take_screenshot()` and `calculate_similarity()` functionalities are presumed pre-defined.

Here's the corrected function:

Changes made:
- Corrected default values for `interval` and `similarity_threshold` to match docstring.
- Updated `base_image_path` with `new_screenshot_path` after a significant change is detected.
- Included file cleanup logic inside the loop and in a `finally` block to handle both the temporary and base screenshot files correctly.
- Ensured `os.remove()` is called only when a new screenshot does not represent a significant change, or after updating `base_image_path`.
- A try-finally block is used to ensure the last taken screenshot is cleaned up in case of an unexpected exit from the loop.
