**Prompt:**
Sometimes this fails and the gh command returns 'could not add label: 'Programming' not found'. I need to automatically heal that and remove the missing label.

could not add label: 'Programming' not found

**Response:**
The error suggests that the 'Programming' label does not exist in the GitHub repository where the `gh` command is being applied. To automatically handle this error, you can write a script that parses the error message and conditionally removes the reference to the 'Programming' label if it is not present in the repository's label set.

Here is a high-level approach to solve this in a shell script:

1. Attempt to add the label using `gh` command.
2. Capture any error output.
3. Check if the error output contains the 'not found' message for the 'Programming' label.
4. If the error is detected, run `gh` command to remove or modify the label from the issue or PR.

Example in bash script pseudo-code:

```bash
#!/bin/bash

# Attempt to add label
error_output=$(gh issue create --label "Programming" 2>&1)

# Check if the output contains 'could not add label: 'Programming' not found'
if [[ "$error_output" == *"could not add label: 'Programming' not found"* ]]; then
  # Logic to handle the missing label scenario
  # Remove or modify the label reference as needed
  # might involve re-running the gh command without the 'Programming' label
fi
```

You could also consider implementing a proactive check before attempting to add labels, querying the repository's labels and verifying the existence of 'Programming'. If it doesn't exist, either create the label in the repository or skip adding it.

For example, a preliminary check using `gh` can be designed as follows:

```bash
# Check if 'Programming' label exists in the repo
if gh label list | grep -q 'Programming'; then
  # Label exists, add it to the issue
  gh issue create --label "Programming" # rest of your command
else
  # Label does not exist, handle accordingly, maybe skip or create it
  # skip or create label code goes here
fi
```

Please note that the above code is written in bash script (commonly used in Unix-like systems) and assumes that `gh` is the GitHub CLI tool. Adjust the script according to your specific environment and error handling logic.
