my logs.db has a table called responses that contains logs of my interactions with the gpt api.

I need to save every conversation to a markdown file. 
Some conversations are contained in a single response row.
Other conversations consist of MULTIPLE response rows and should be cated by conversation_id

The markdown document should consist of:
prompt
response
options_json
prompt
response
options_json
... until all parts of the conversation are included.

Each prompt/response pair should include a colapsible md field to record:
duration_ms
datetime_utc
response_json.model 
response_json contains, e.g. {"content": " No", "role": null, "finish_reason": null, "logprobs": [{"text": " No", "top_logprobs": [{" No": -1.2232164, " no": -1.5087332}]}, {"text": "", "top_logprobs": []}], "id": "cmpl-8Lb2al4kbNvcfYhfOzqkmgHIhTe50", "object": "text_completion", "model": "gpt-3.5-turbo-instruct", "created": 1700157964}




**Response:**
To save every conversation to a markdown file, here are the steps you would need to take using SQL queries and scripting (e.g., Python/bash scripting):

1. Extract conversations.
2. Construct markdown documents.
3. Save markdown documents.

Assuming we're using a scripting language like Python with a library for SQLite manipulation (e.g., `sqlite3`):

```python
import sqlite3
import json

# Connect to the database
conn = sqlite3.connect('logs.db')

# 1. Extract conversations:
# Query to get all related responses for each conversation, ordered by datetime.
query = '''
    SELECT r.prompt, r.response, r.options_json, r.duration_ms, r.datetime_utc, r.response_json, c.id
    FROM responses r
    JOIN conversations c ON r.conversation_id = c.id
    ORDER BY r.datetime_utc ASC
'''
cursor = conn.execute(query)

# 2. Construct markdown documents:
current_conversation_id = None
markdown_content = ""

for row in cursor:
    prompt, response, options_json, duration_ms, datetime_utc, response_json, conversation_id = row
    if conversation_id != current_conversation_id:
        if current_conversation_id is not None:
            # Save previous conversation to its markdown file
            with open(f"{current_conversation_id}.md", 'w') as file:
                file.write(markdown_content)
            markdown_content = ""  # Reset for new conversation
        current_conversation_id = conversation_id

    # JSON loading for extracting model
    response_json_data = json.loads(response_json)
    model = response_json_data.get('model', 'Unknown')

    # Construct markdown content for the current row
    markdown_content += f"**Prompt:**\n{prompt}\n\n**Response:**\n{response}\n\n<details><summary>Metadata</summary>\n\n- Duration: {duration_ms} ms\n- Datetime: {datetime_utc}\n- Model: {model}\n\n</details>\n\n**Options:**\n```json\n{options_json}\n```\n\n"

# 3. Save last markdown document:
if current_conversation_id is not None:
    # Don't forget to save the last conversation if there were any
    with open(f"{current_conversation_id}.md", 'w') as file:
        file.write(markdown_content)

# Close the connection to the database
conn.close()
```

This script iterates over rows of related responses, joining the data on `conversation_id`. For each new conversation, the previous one is saved to a markdown file named with the `conversation_id`. Each prompt/response pair, along with their metadata and options, are formatted in Markdown collapsible details tags. The script concludes by closing the database connection. This assumes that conversation IDs are unique and valid for use as filenames. If not, some sanitization might be necessary.

Remember to adapt the file paths and database connection as needed for your environment.

response_json: {"content": "To loop over each character in a string in Bash, you can use a `for` loop combined with the `grep` command.

Here is an example:

```bash
string=\"Hello, World!\"

for ((i=0; i<${#string}; i++)); do
    character=\"${string:$i:1}\"
    echo \"$character\"
done
```

In this example, we declare the `$string` variable with the value \"Hello, World!\". Then, we create a `for` loop that iterates from 0 to the length of the string (`${#string}`). In each iteration, we use the `${string:$i:1}` syntax to extract one character at the current index `$i` and assign it to the `$character` variable. Finally, we output each character using the `echo` command.", "role": "assistant", "finish_reason": "stop", "id": "chatcmpl-7fo1UCEe4xgoq67HOuCCZttGGXGH0", "object": "chat.completion.chunk", "model": "gpt-3.5-turbo-0613", "created": 1690198092}

TypeError: the JSON object must be str, bytes or bytearray, not NoneType

**Response:**
The Python script crashed because the `json.loads` function is called with `None` as an argument when `response_json` is `None`. The script needs to handle cases where `response_json` might be `None`.

To handle this, update the script to check if `response_json` is not `None` before attempting to parse it as JSON. Here's the modified section of the script:

```python
# ...

for row in cursor:
    prompt, response, options_json, duration_ms, datetime_utc, response_json, conversation_id = row

    # Check if conversation_id has changed and if we need to save the current markdown content
    if conversation_id != current_conversation_id:
        # ...

    # Only parse response_json if it is not None
    model = "Unknown"
    if response_json:
        try:
            response_json_data = json.loads(response_json)
            model = response_json_data.get('model', 'Unknown')
        except json.JSONDecodeError:
            # Handle the case where response_json is not a valid JSON string
            pass  # or log an error message

    # Construct markdown content for the current row with the rest of the fields
    # ...

# Don't forget to save the last conversation if there were any
# ...

# Close the connection to the database
# ...
```

This adjustment skips parsing for `response_json` if it's `None` and handles JSON decode errors to prevent the script from crashing.
