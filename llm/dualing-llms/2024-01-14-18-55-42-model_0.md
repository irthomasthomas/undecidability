To ensure that the Nyxt browser window is always brought to the front after opening a link in a bash script, you can use the `xdotool` command-line tool.

Here's how you can achieve it:

1. Install `xdotool` if it isn't already installed on your system:
```bash
sudo pacman -S xdotool
```

2. Modify your bash script to use `xdotool` to bring the Nyxt window to the front after opening the link.

Assuming you have a command like this in your script to open the link in Nyxt:
```bash
nyxt https://example.com
```

You can modify it as follows:
```bash
nyxt https://example.com &
sleep 1
xdotool search --name "nyxt" windowactivate
```

Explanation:
- The `&` at the end of the `nyxt` command runs it in the background, allowing the script to continue.
- The `sleep 1` command waits for 1 second to give Nyxt enough time to open the link and create its window.
- The `xdotool search --name "nyxt" windowactivate` command searches for the Nyxt window by its name and brings it to the front.

Now, when you run your modified script, the Nyxt window should always be brought to the front after opening a link.

Note: Make sure the Nyxt window title matches the name provided in `xdotool search --name "nyxt"` command. Adjust the name accordingly if needed.

I hope this helps! Let me know if you have any further questions.
