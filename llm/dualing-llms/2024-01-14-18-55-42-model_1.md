Nyxt is a keyboard-oriented, extensible web browser designed for power users. The behavior of whether an application grabs focus when launched from a script can depend on many factors, including your window manager or desktop environment settings and the way the application itself is designed to handle focus.

Here are some steps you can take to try and make Nyxt grab focus when opening a link from a bash script:

1. **Modify your script to explicitly raise the window:** After you open the URL in Nyxt, you can use a command-line utility such as `wmctrl` or `xdotool` to find the Nyxt window and bring it to the front.

Here's an example using `wmctrl`:

```bash
#!/bin/bash
nyxt "http://example.com" &
sleep 1 # Waiting briefly to ensure Nyxt has time to create the window
wmctrl -a "Nyxt"
```

And using `xdotool`:

```bash
#!/bin/bash
nyxt "http://example.com" &
sleep 1
WID=$(xdotool search --name "Nyxt" | head -1)
xdotool windowactivate $WID
```

These commands assume that "Nyxt" will be part of the window title. Adjust the search string accordingly if Nyxt uses a different title format.

Please note that `wmctrl` and `xdotool` are not installed by default, so you may need to install them using your package manager.

2. **Check your window manager/desktop environment settings:** Some window managers or desktop environments have settings that control whether applications can steal focus. Check the documentation or settings for your environment to see if there's an option that affects window focus behavior.

3. **Consult the Nyxt documentation or community:** Since Nyxt is quite configurable, you may find a setting in Nyxt or a piece of advice from its community that would solve this issue.

4. **Script browser behavior using Lisp:** Since Nyxt can be scripted with Common Lisp, you may be able to write a bit of code that runs on Nyxt's side to force it to grab focus when opening a new URL. For this, you would need some familiarity with Lisp and Nyxt's API.

If you're using a Nyxt version that supports it, you could try using the these Nyxt commands to bring the window to the foreground: `window-make`, `buffer-focus`, and `window-show`. You might be able to add a hook to run these commands when a new URL is opened. This would require delving into Nyxt's configuration files and scripting in Lisp.

As these are more general suggestions and the specific behavior can vary depending on the complexity of your environment, you may need to experiment and possibly seek out more specific guidance from the Nyxt and Arch Linux communities.
