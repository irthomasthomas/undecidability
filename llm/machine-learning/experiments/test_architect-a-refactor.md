Below is the refactored source code with my comments and suggestions for improvements:

## REFACTORED BASH SCRIPT ##
```bash
#!/bin/bash

# Good usage of shebang for portability and correctness.

# This Bash script loops over all .py files in the current directory and uses ctags to
# create a list of function names within them.

# To ensure maintainability, consider adding a description area with usage instructions,
# author info, and script description.

# Define a function that processes Python files to extract function signatures.
process_python_files() {
    ctags -R --languages=python --python-kinds=-i-v -f- --fields=n *.py | \
    while IFS= read -r tagline; do
        # Use a more descriptive variable name instead of "line" to enhance readability.
        if [[ $tagline =~ ^([a-zA-Z_][a-zA-Z0-9_]*)	 ]]; then
            # Here, BASH_REMATCH extracts the function name. It's essential to document
            # regex for clarity.
            # Additionally, consider error handling for cases where ctags might not work as expected.
            # Adding more comments for complex regex patterns increases maintainability.
            echo "Function: ${BASH_REMATCH[1]}"
        fi
    done
}

# Invoke the function to process files.
process_python_files
```

## REFACTORED PYTHON SCRIPT ##
```python
#!/usr/bin/env python3
# Good usage of shebang for portability and ease of execution.

import ast
import os

# It is good practice to use the 'if __name__ == "__main__":' guard to ensure
# that the script can also be imported without executing the main code block.

# Define a class that inherits from ast.NodeVisitor to extract functions.
class FunctionVisitor(ast.NodeVisitor):
    # Using type hints can be very beneficial for readability and maintainability.
    def visit_FunctionDef(self, node: ast.FunctionDef):
        # Format string usage is good for readability.
        # Documenting what 'ast.unparse(node.args)' is doing would be helpful.
        print(f"Function: {node.name}{ast.unparse(node.args)}")

# The primary functionality could be encapsulated in a function,
# which will improve the modularity and testability of the script.
def process_python_files(directory: str):
    # The 'directory: str' type hint improves clarity on the expected parameter.

    for filename in os.listdir(directory):
        # It's good to filter for .py files.
        if filename.endswith('.py'):
            # Exception handling should be added here to catch issues with file reading.
            # It is also better to handle potential encoding issues with a try-except block.
            with open(filename, 'r', encoding='utf-8') as file:
                # Parsing the AST from a file is non-trivial; consider adding comments.
                source_content = file.read()
                node = ast.parse(source_content, filename=filename)
                # Creating a new visitor instance for each file is appropriate.
                FunctionVisitor().visit(node)

# Enclose script main entry point with the appropriate guard.
if __name__ == "__main__":
    # Call the function with the current directory. Consider accepting command-line arguments.
    process_python_files('.')

# Overall, the Python script is well-structured and well-commented, but by making these changes,
# it will become more robust and maintainable.
```

By refactoring the code in these ways, we improve documentation, readability, code modularity, and adherence to best practices, thus maintaining high professional standards.
