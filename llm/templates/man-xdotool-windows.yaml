           --name newname
               Set window WM_NAME (the window title, usually)

           --icon-name newiconname
               Set window WM_ICON_NAME (the window title when minimized, usually)

           --role newrole
               Set window WM_WINDOW_ROLE

           --classname newclassname
               Set window class name (not to be confused with window class)

           --class newclass
               Set window class (not to be confused with window class name)

           --urgency value
               Set  window  urgency  hint.  If the value is 1, the window will be marked urgent, and the window manager will somehow
               highlight it for the user's attention.  If the value is 0, the window will be marked non-urgent.

           --overrideredirect value
               Set window's override_redirect value. This value is a hint to the window manager for whether  or  not  it  should  be
               managed. If the redirect value is 0, then the window manager will draw borders and treat this window normally. If the
               value is 1, the window manager will ignore this window.

               If  you change this value, your window manager may not notice the change until the window is mapped again, so you may
               want to issue 'windowunmap' and 'windowmap' to make the window manager take note.
