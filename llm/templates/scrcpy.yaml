    scrcpy 2.1.1 <https://github.com/Genymobile/scrcpy>
    Usage: scrcpy [options]

    Options:

        --always-on-top
            Make scrcpy window always on top (above other windows).

        --audio-bit-rate=value
            Encode the audio at the given bit rate, expressed in bits/s. Unit
            suffixes are supported: 'K' (x1000) and 'M' (x1000000).
            Default is 128K (128000).

        --audio-buffer=ms
            Configure the audio buffering delay (in milliseconds).
            Lower values decrease the latency, but increase the likelyhood of buffer
            underrun (causing audio glitches).
            Default is 50.

        --audio-codec=name
            Select an audio codec (opus, aac or raw).
            Default is opus.

        --audio-codec-options=key[:type]=value[,...]
            Set a list of comma-separated key:type=value options for the device
            audio encoder.
            The possible values for 'type' are 'int' (default), 'long', 'float' and
            'string'.
            The list of possible codec options is available in the Android
            documentation:
            <https://d.android.com/reference/android/media/MediaFormat>

        --audio-encoder=name
            Use a specific MediaCodec audio encoder (depending on the codec provided
            by --audio-codec).
            The available encoders can be listed by --list-encoders.

        --audio-source=source
            Select the audio source (output or mic).
            Default is output.

        --audio-output-buffer=ms
            Configure the size of the SDL audio output buffer (in milliseconds).
            If you get "robotic" audio playback, you should test with a higher value
            (10). Do not change this setting otherwise.
            Default is 5.

        -b, --video-bit-rate=value
            Encode the video at the given bit rate, expressed in bits/s. Unit
            suffixes are supported: 'K' (x1000) and 'M' (x1000000).
            Default is 8M (8000000).

        --crop=width:height:x:y
            Crop the device screen on the server.
            The values are expressed in the device natural orientation (typically,
            portrait for a phone, landscape for a tablet). Any --max-size value is
            computed on the cropped size.

        -d, --select-usb
            Use USB device (if there is exactly one, like adb -d).
            Also see -e (--select-tcpip).

        --disable-screensaver
            Disable screensaver while scrcpy is running.

        --display=id
            Specify the device display id to mirror.
            The available display ids can be listed by:
                scrcpy --list-displays
            Default is 0.

        --display-buffer=ms
            Add a buffering delay (in milliseconds) before displaying. This
            increases latency to compensate for jitter.
            Default is 0 (no buffering).

        -e, --select-tcpip
            Use TCP/IP device (if there is exactly one, like adb -e).
            Also see -d (--select-usb).

        -f, --fullscreen
            Start in fullscreen.

        --force-adb-forward
            Do not attempt to use "adb reverse" to connect to the device.

        --forward-all-clicks
            By default, right-click triggers BACK (or POWER on) and middle-click
            triggers HOME. This option disables these shortcuts and forwards the
            clicks to the device instead.

        -h, --help
            Print this help.

        --kill-adb-on-close
            Kill adb when scrcpy terminates.

        -K, --hid-keyboard
            Simulate a physical keyboard by using HID over AOAv2.
            It provides a better experience for IME users, and allows to generate
            non-ASCII characters, contrary to the default injection method.
            It may only work over USB.
            The keyboard layout must be configured (once and for all) on the device,
            via Settings -> System -> Languages and input -> Physical keyboard. This
            settings page can be started directly: `adb shell am start -a
            android.settings.HARD_KEYBOARD_SETTINGS`.
            However, the option is only available when the HID keyboard is enabled
            (or a physical keyboard is connected).
            Also see --hid-mouse.

        --legacy-paste
            Inject computer clipboard text as a sequence of key events on Ctrl+v
            (like MOD+Shift+v).
            This is a workaround for some devices not behaving as expected when
            setting the device clipboard programmatically.

        --list-displays
            List device displays.

        --list-encoders
            List video and audio encoders available on the device.

        --lock-video-orientation[=value]
            Lock video orientation to value.
            Possible values are "unlocked", "initial" (locked to the initial
            orientation), 0, 1, 2 and 3. Natural device orientation is 0, and each
            increment adds a 90 degrees rotation counterclockwise.
            Default is "unlocked".
            Passing the option without argument is equivalent to passing "initial".

        -m, --max-size=value
            Limit both the width and height of the video to value. The other
            dimension is computed so that the device aspect-ratio is preserved.
            Default is 0 (unlimited).

        -M, --hid-mouse
            Simulate a physical mouse by using HID over AOAv2.
            In this mode, the computer mouse is captured to control the device
            directly (relative mouse mode).
            LAlt, LSuper or RSuper toggle the capture mode, to give control of the
            mouse back to the computer.
            It may only work over USB.
            Also see --hid-keyboard.

        --max-fps=value
            Limit the frame rate of screen capture (officially supported since
            Android 10, but may work on earlier versions).

        -n, --no-control
            Disable device control (mirror the device in read-only).

        -N, --no-playback
            Disable video and audio playback on the computer (equivalent to
            --no-video-playback --no-audio-playback).

        --no-audio
            Disable audio forwarding.

        --no-audio-playback
            Disable audio playback on the computer.

        --no-cleanup
            By default, scrcpy removes the server binary from the device and
            restores the device state (show touches, stay awake and power mode) on
            exit.
            This option disables this cleanup.

        --no-clipboard-autosync
            By default, scrcpy automatically synchronizes the computer clipboard to
            the device clipboard before injecting Ctrl+v, and the device clipboard
            to the computer clipboard whenever it changes.
            This option disables this automatic synchronization.

        --no-downsize-on-error
            By default, on MediaCodec error, scrcpy automatically tries again with a
            lower definition.
            This option disables this behavior.

        --no-key-repeat
            Do not forward repeated key events when a key is held down.

        --no-mipmaps
            If the renderer is OpenGL 3.0+ or OpenGL ES 2.0+, then mipmaps are
            automatically generated to improve downscaling quality. This option
            disables the generation of mipmaps.

        --no-power-on
            Do not power on the device on start.

        --no-video
            Disable video forwarding.

        --no-video-playback
            Disable video playback on the computer.

        --otg
            Run in OTG mode: simulate physical keyboard and mouse, as if the
            computer keyboard and mouse were plugged directly to the device via an
            OTG cable.
            In this mode, adb (USB debugging) is not necessary, and mirroring is
            disabled.
            LAlt, LSuper or RSuper toggle the mouse capture mode, to give control of
            the mouse back to the computer.
            If any of --hid-keyboard or --hid-mouse is set, only enable keyboard or
            mouse respectively, otherwise enable both.
            It may only work over USB.
            See --hid-keyboard and --hid-mouse.

        -p, --port=port[:port]
            Set the TCP port (range) used by the client to listen.
            Default is 27183:27199.

        --power-off-on-close
            Turn the device screen off when closing scrcpy.

        --prefer-text
            Inject alpha characters and space as text events instead of key events.
            This avoids issues when combining multiple keys to enter a special
            character, but breaks the expected behavior of alpha keys in games
            (typically WASD).

        --print-fps
            Start FPS counter, to print framerate logs to the console. It can be
            started or stopped at any time with MOD+i.

        --push-target=path
            Set the target directory for pushing files to the device by drag & drop.
            It is passed as is to "adb push".
            Default is "/sdcard/Download/".

        -r, --record=file.mp4
            Record screen to file.
            The format is determined by the --record-format option if set, or by the
            file extension (.mp4 or .mkv).

        --raw-key-events
            Inject key events for all input keys, and ignore text events.

        --record-format=format
            Force recording format (either mp4 or mkv).

        --render-driver=name
            Request SDL to use the given render driver (this is just a hint).
            Supported names are currently "direct3d", "opengl", "opengles2",
            "opengles", "metal" and "software".
            <https://wiki.libsdl.org/SDL_HINT_RENDER_DRIVER>

        --require-audio
            By default, scrcpy mirrors only the video when audio capture fails on
            the device. This option makes scrcpy fail if audio is enabled but does
            not work.

        --rotation=value
            Set the initial display rotation.
            Possible values are 0, 1, 2 and 3. Each increment adds a 90 degrees
            rotation counterclockwise.

        -s, --serial=serial
            The device serial number. Mandatory only if several devices are
            connected to adb.

        -S, --turn-screen-off
            Turn the device screen off immediately.

        --shortcut-mod=key[+...][,...]
            Specify the modifiers to use for scrcpy shortcuts.
            Possible keys are "lctrl", "rctrl", "lalt", "ralt", "lsuper" and
            "rsuper".
            A shortcut can consist in several keys, separated by '+'. Several
            shortcuts can be specified, separated by ','.
            For example, to use either LCtrl+LAlt or LSuper for scrcpy shortcuts,
            pass "lctrl+lalt,lsuper".
            Default is "lalt,lsuper" (left-Alt or left-Super).

        -t, --show-touches
            Enable "show touches" on start, restore the initial value on exit.
            It only shows physical touches (not clicks from scrcpy).

        --tcpip[=ip[:port]]
            Configure and reconnect the device over TCP/IP.
            If a destination address is provided, then scrcpy connects to this
            address before starting. The device must listen on the given TCP port
            (default is 5555).
            If no destination address is provided, then scrcpy attempts to find the
            IP address of the current device (typically connected over USB), enables
            TCP/IP mode, then connects to this address before starting.

        --time-limit=seconds
            Set the maximum mirroring time, in seconds.

        --tunnel-host=ip
            Set the IP address of the adb tunnel to reach the scrcpy server. This
            option automatically enables --force-adb-forward.
            Default is localhost.

        --tunnel-port=port
            Set the TCP port of the adb tunnel to reach the scrcpy server. This
            option automatically enables --force-adb-forward.
            Default is 0 (not forced): the local port used for establishing the
            tunnel will be used.

        -v, --version
            Print the version of scrcpy.

        -V, --verbosity=value
            Set the log level (verbose, debug, info, warn or error).
            Default is info.

        --v4l2-sink=/dev/videoN
            Output to v4l2loopback device.
            It requires to lock the video orientation (see
            --lock-video-orientation).
            This feature is only available on Linux.

        --v4l2-buffer=ms
            Add a buffering delay (in milliseconds) before pushing frames. This
            increases latency to compensate for jitter.
            This option is similar to --display-buffer, but specific to V4L2 sink.
            Default is 0 (no buffering).
            This option is only available on Linux.

        --video-codec=name
            Select a video codec (h264, h265 or av1).
            Default is h264.

        --video-codec-options=key[:type]=value[,...]
            Set a list of comma-separated key:type=value options for the device
            video encoder.
            The possible values for 'type' are 'int' (default), 'long', 'float' and
            'string'.
            The list of possible codec options is available in the Android
            documentation:
            <https://d.android.com/reference/android/media/MediaFormat>

        --video-encoder=name
            Use a specific MediaCodec video encoder (depending on the codec provided
            by --video-codec).
            The available encoders can be listed by --list-encoders.

        -w, --stay-awake
            Keep the device on while scrcpy is running, when the device is plugged
            in.

        --window-borderless
            Disable window decorations (display borderless window).

        --window-title=text
            Set a custom window title.

        --window-x=value
            Set the initial window horizontal position.
            Default is "auto".

        --window-y=value
            Set the initial window vertical position.
            Default is "auto".

        --window-width=value
            Set the initial window width.
            Default is 0 (automatic).

        --window-height=value
            Set the initial window height.
            Default is 0 (automatic).

    Shortcuts:

        In the following list, MOD is the shortcut modifier. By default, it's (left)
        Alt or (left) Super, but it can be configured by --shortcut-mod (see above).
