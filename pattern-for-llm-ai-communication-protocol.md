If I were starting from scratch, I'd focus on creating a communication protocol that is robust and handles multi-line data without ambiguity. Here's how I might tackle this:

### Step 1: Define a clear communication protocol

For communication between the Nyxt browser and the Bash script, we'll use a defined format to ensure that multi-line selections are transmitted without getting truncated. Each section of data (Title, URL, Selection) will be enclosed in identifiable markers. For example:

```
--BEGIN TITLE--
This is the page title
--END TITLE--
--BEGIN URL--
https://example.com
--END URL--
--BEGIN SELECTION--
This is the selected text,
which can span multiple lines
and include various characters.
--END SELECTION--
```

This helps us to parse blocks of text reliably without confusion about where one field ends and another begins.

### Step 2: Create the Bash script to handle complex input

```bash
#!/bin/bash
# nyxt_to_github.sh

monitor_nyxt_to_gh_pipe() {
    local fifo_path="/tmp/nyxt_gh_data"
    local issue_data
    local TITLE=""
    local URL=""
    local SELECTION=""
    local parsing_section=""

    echo "monitoring pipe" >&2

    while IFS= read -r line; do
        case "$line" in
            --BEGIN\ TITLE--*) parsing_section="TITLE" ;;
            --BEGIN\ URL--*) parsing_section="URL" ;;
            --BEGIN\ SELECTION--*) parsing_section="SELECTION" ;;
            --END\ TITLE--*) parsing_section="" ;;
            --END\ URL--*) parsing_section="" ;;
            --END\ SELECTION--*)
                parsing_section=""
                # Process the ISSUE
                /home/thomas/Development/Projects/llm/label-maker/github_issues.sh "$TITLE" "$URL" "$SELECTION"
                # Reset variables for the next issue
                TITLE=""
                URL=""
                SELECTION=""
                ;;
            *)
                if [ "$parsing_section" = "TITLE" ]; then
                    TITLE+=$'\n'"$line"
                elif [ "$parsing_section" = "URL" ]; then
                    URL+=$'\n'"$line"
                elif [ "$parsing_section" = "SELECTION" ]; then
                    SELECTION+=$'\n'"$line"
                fi
                ;;
        esac
    done < "$fifo_path"
}

target_project="undecidability"
target_directory="$HOME/$target_project"
cd "$target_directory" || exit 2
echo "$PWD"

fifo_path="/tmp/nyxt_gh_data"
if [ ! -p "$fifo_path" ]; then
    mkfifo "$fifo_path"
    echo "Created named pipe: $fifo_path" >&2
fi

# Main loop
echo "Starting nyxt-to-gh.sh"
while true; do
    monitor_nyxt_to_gh_pipe
    sleep 5
done
```

### Step 3: Adjust the Lisp client script

Update the Lisp client script to output data in the predefined format:

```lisp
(define-command-global gh-send-selection-to-issue ()
  "Sends url, title, and selection to a new gh issue via a single FIFO"
  (let* ((title (title (current-buffer)))
         (myurl (url (current-buffer)))
         (selection (ps-eval (ps:chain window (get-selection) (to-string))))
         (fifo-path "/tmp/nyxt_gh_data"))
    (with-open-file (stream fifo-path
                            :direction :output
                            :if-exists :supersede
                            :if-does-not-exist :create)
      (format stream "--BEGIN TITLE--~%~a~%--END TITLE--~%--BEGIN URL--~%~a~%--END URL--~%--BEGIN SELECTION--~%~a~%--END SELECTION--~%" title (render-url myurl) selection))))
```

This way, you have a structured format that is reliable and handles multi-line content gracefully. Moreover, it makes it easier to expand in the future; you could simply introduce new sections with different markers if needed. 

Always remember to handle input sanitization/escaping to ensure that the content does not interfere with the intended execution of commands or scripts, and test thoroughly with different types of selections, including edge cases that may include the same markers or special characters.
