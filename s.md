It occured to me just, that the experience of the average house cat is not too dissimilar from that of the (misslabeled) ADHD human. The cat uses all its skills in stalking and hunting to bring home to its human the greatest gift a cat could give. One plump and juicy mouse, so fresh that it tries to get away, giving the happy cat an opportunity to demonstrate his skills before his human. And what reward does the cat receive for it's victory? It gets yelled at and chased out of the house, and the prize that was so hard won, discarded as so much chaf. The cat is a hunter. It's function is to explore, stalk, and hunt, and bring home the prey to it's hungry family.  The adhd human is a hunter-gatherer. We lock eyes on our prey and stalk it where ever it leads. The danger and significance of the hunt focuses the mind. Where once there was a constant stream of thoughts fighting for attention, all demanding to be organised and prioritiesed, but every idea seems just as important, just as urgent, and every new idea triggers a ...
